  name: AWTRIX Weather ⛈️ + Forecast + 🌕️ (Service Calls)
  description: >
    This is somewhat of a mega-weather blueprint with moon phase support. However for it work correctly you will need a variety of different things setup. It was initially designed to use in partnership with a personal weather station however it seems to work fine with OpenWeather as well or any other provider that offers an hourly forecast.

    This blueprint will publish to two separate topics.  `jeef_weather` for the weather report and `jeef_weather_sun` if its near sunrise/set

    ## ⚠️ REQUIREMENTS ⚠️

    For this blueprint to work you MUST have a few things pre-setup.

    ### Moon Integration 🌕️
         .------.
        ( I MOON )    ..
         `------'   .' /
              O    /  ;
                o i  OO
                 C    `-.  Make sure you've
                 |    <-'      enabled
                 (  ,--.   the MOON Sensor
                  V  \_)
                   \  :
                    `._\.


    The moon integration is required. You can add it via the [moon](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/moon/) page or just by [clicking here](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=moon)

    ### Moon Rise/Set Sensor 🌕️ ⏲️

              M
             (X)
            // \\   Lets use a GeoLocation to find
           //   \\     out the Moon Rise / Set
          //     \\       TIMES
         //       \\
        /           \

    As Home Assistant doesn't _currently_ provide moon rise/set times you will need to get this from some api.
    You can use the [ipgeolocation](https://app.ipgeolocation.io) API.

    To do so you will need to create an account and extract your `API_KEY`. Additionally you need your `LAT` and `LON`.

    Then you can add a [REST](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sensor.rest/) sensor to your `configuraiton.yaml` file like the one here:

        resource: https://api.ipgeolocation.io/astronomy?lat=<LAT>&long=<LON>&apiKey=<API_KEY>
        name: ip_geo_location
        scan_interval: 300
        value_template: "OK"
        json_attributes:
          - moonrise
          - moonset
          - moon_altitude

    ### Icons

    You can call my custom script which will prompt you for an Awtrix device and then upload the required icons:

      (If you have windows I don't know if this will work)

        bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeeftor/HomeAssistant/master/icons/upload_icon.sh)"

    _This blueprint ~will~ may be updated as new features_

        Please select how and when you want the moon displayed


        By selecting `Always show moon` the moon will always be drawn to the right of the display. Otherwise the moon will only be drawn if its risen depending on the option selected.

        ### NOTE:

          At Brightness values less than 29 the greys of the moon will render green on the clock.

      selector:

              value: always
            - label: Only show moon if its risen
              value: risen
            - label: Only show moon if risen + night

      default: "night"

    use_moon_clear_night:
      name: Swap Clear Night for Moon
      description: >-

        The default case is for the moon to be drawn to the right-side of the clock, however, you have the option if this is selected to repalce the `clear_night` icon with the moon icon. This will only swap icons if the moon is currently being displayed.
