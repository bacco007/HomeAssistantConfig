# üè†TBSmartHome - Home Assistant Configuration

<img align="right" src="./.assets/logo.png?raw=true">

This is my [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) configuration - based on many of the other great configurations are out there (and listed below)

I live in ![Australia](http://flags.ox3.in/mini/au.png) so some of what you find here may not be relevent, or you may have access to better (and probably cheaper) ways.

It's very much a work-in-progress, but feel free to steal ideas or code to use for your own setup

_Please :star: this repo if you find it useful_

## TL;DR

This is my Home Assistant config - documentation isn't my strongest skill, so if you've got any questions, hit me up

<p align="right"><a href="#top" title="Back to top">Top</a></p>

## Ecosystem

My smarthome setup seems to be ever-growing, but at this stage it's unlikely that I'll make any major changes from here

### Hardware

- Dell Optiplex 9020 SFF (i5, 24Gb RAM, 500Gb HDD) running Proxmox
  - I run three VMs from this machine, one for Home Assistant (Using HassOS) and the other two for other home server stuff
- Lenovo ThinkMachine M73 Tiny (Intel Pentium G3240T, 4Gb RAM, 500Gb HDD)
  - Ubuntu Server 18.10, this machine runs my UniFi controller and Nginx Reverse Proxy Setup
- Raspberry Pi 3
  - Pi-Hole

### Zigbee

I'm running a combination of Xiaomi Aqara and Samsung SmartThings sensors and a ConBee II as the host
