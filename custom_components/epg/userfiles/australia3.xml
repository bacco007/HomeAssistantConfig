Jennifer Saunders hosts this second episode as four celebrities face their three challenges set by judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood. The bakers on the starting line are former Labour politician Ed Balls, writer and presenter Victoria Coren Mitchell, sports commentator Chris Kamara, and singer and actor Kimberley Walsh. The bakers must make 24 identical American-style muffins for their signature challenge, football pies in the technical challenge and, finally, show-stopping tiered cakes representing an extreme sport. Interesting flavours and confusion abound in this baking battle. Who will bag the coveted title of star baker? While the bakers aim to inspire others to raise money, Denise Lewis visits a project in Tyne and Wear where she meets Linda and Hughie. Hughie was diagnosed with dementia six years ago at the age of 59. Denise finds out how money raised really does make a difference to his quality of life.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.1.</episode-num></programme>

Judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood set three tasks to test each celebritys baking prowess, while comedian Ed Byrne is on hand to guide them through. The celebrities taking up the baking baton this time are ex-Spice Girl Geri Horner, BBC world affairs editor John Simpson, footballer and pundit Jermaine Jenas, and 1990s pop sensation Louise Redknapp. The first hurdle for the bakers is the signature challenge, where they take on savoury tarts. Up next, its the technical challenge: Marys chocolate and beetroot tray bake. The bakers must follow a stripped-back recipe to produce this moist, malty sponge, covered with a cream-cheese icing and decorated with candied beetroot. On day two, the bakers have one last chance to impress the judges in a bid to claim the Sport Relief Star Baker apron. For this final task, the showstopper bake, they attempt to make 3D models of their favourite sporting moments out of biscuits. When it comes to the crunch, who will crumble under the pressure and who will triumph to take home the title of Star Baker? While the celebrity bakers hope to inspire others to get involved in fundraising for Sport Relief, Clare Balding visits Kenya to learn about the work of Sport Relief there, and the difference the money raised is making in the fight against malaria. She visits children in hospital battling the disease and sees how donations can help prevent such suffering.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num></programme>

Judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood set three tasks to test each celebritys baking prowess, while comedian Sarah Millican is on hand to guide them through. The celebrities taking up the baking baton this time are actor Alison Steadman, comedian Ade Edmondson, singer Will Young, and actor and comedian Morgana Robinson. The signature challenge is to create an open-top pie. For the technical challenge they attempt a salmon roulade. Finally, they must make a show-stopping creation depicting a momentous life experience - in cupcakes. Which of the bakes will measure up to the exacting standards of the judges and win them the coveted Star Baker apron? While the celebrity bakers hope to inspire others to get involved in fundraising for Sport Relief, Clare Balding visits Kenya to learn about the work of Sport Relief there.
