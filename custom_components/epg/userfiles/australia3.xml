The Bill in question is 80+ New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham. For decades, this Schwinn-riding cultural anthropologist has been obsessively and inventively chronicling fashion trends and high society charity soirees for the Times Style section in his columns On the Street and Evening Hours. Documenting uptown fixtures (Wintour, Tom Wolfe, Brooke Astor, David Rockefeller-who all appear in the film out of their love for Bill), downtown eccentrics and everyone in between, Cunninghams enormous body of work is more reliable than any catwalk as an expression of time, place and individual flair. In turn, this is a delicate, funny and often poignant portrait of a dedicated artist whose only wealth is his own humanity and unassuming grace.</desc></programme>

The Bill in question is 80+ New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham. For decades, this Schwinn-riding cultural anthropologist has been obsessively and inventively chronicling fashion trends and high society charity soirees for the Times Style section in his columns On the Street and Evening Hours. Documenting uptown fixtures (Wintour, Tom Wolfe, Brooke Astor, David Rockefeller-who all appear in the film out of their love for Bill), downtown eccentrics and everyone in between, Cunninghams enormous body of work is more reliable than any catwalk as an expression of time, place and individual flair. In turn, this is a delicate, funny and often poignant portrait of a dedicated artist whose only wealth is his own humanity and unassuming grace.</desc></programme>

They sample some great food, visit well known sites, and experience fun activities such as white water rafting and indoor skydiving. Most importantly, they meet a host of extraordinary women, young and old, and talk about identity, purpose, relationships, beauty, choices, and much more. Throughout their travels, Jeni and Sarah will have fun, but they will always bring each episode back to one central theme: teaching young ladies about Gods grace in their lives and addressing relevant issues in a redemptive way. Jeni: Seeking the Extraordinary is different than other youth-oriented reality TV for many reasons and will stand out as a positive, biblically-based alternative to many of the secular reality shows that depict todays youth in a negative light. It offers another option for reality TV fans that love the genre but are turned off by the reckless behaviour and non-existent values system of most secular reality-based programming. In a time when immorality, irreverence, and confusion have become ordinary, Jeni: Seeking the Extraordinary will always take the high road to the extraordinary.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num></programme>

This can cause a major paradigm shift as people reevaluate everything in their life including their belief system, relationships, what they value and how they approach daily life. Being confronted with pain, death or the threat of life can force someone to reassess their understanding and worldview as well as reconsider what is truly important. It shakes up the why and what we live for everyday and can propel a person into a new way of being and interacting with the world. Artist, Jess Le Clercs story captures how finding new meaning after escaping death has caused her to reinvent her life to find renewed purpose and authenticity. Psychologically, this process of renewal and re-creation doesnt always happen in an instant, it often involves wrestling in dark places with an unknown end. But once on the other side of the tunnel, life is viewed with a new perspective which can take time for others to adjust to.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.0.</episode-num></programme>

The police rush to establish motive and solve the towns first murders in over a century. The CSI unit combs the scene and finds nothing valuable is missing. However, blood splatter analysis shows they are looking for more than one killer. The family rumour mill points to the black sheep of the Stock clan, Matt Livers. Family members say he threatened Wayne the day before the murders. Matt says hes innocent but he fails a polygraph. After hours of intense interrogation he cracks and confesses. Matt also implicates his cousin, Nick Sampson. But two days later Matt recants and the case stalls. That is until investigators focus on a gold ring found on the kitchen floor of the farmhouse. Forensic tests find traces of the victims blood and an unknown womans DNA on the ring. When investigators trace the ring to a stolen truck in Wisconsin and teenage lovers on a drug-fuelled crime spree, suddenly detectives have four prime suspects. To make things worse, there are allegations that investigators planted evidence. Now, not only Murdock, but all of Nebraska wants to know who really murdered Wayne and Sharmon Stock.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.4.</episode-num></programme>

Moat shot and wounded his ex-girlfriend before killing her new partner in Newcastle during the summer of 2010. He then shot and blinded PC David Rathband.

The police rush to establish motive and solve the towns first murders in over a century. The CSI unit combs the scene and finds nothing valuable is missing. However, blood splatter analysis shows they are looking for more than one killer. The family rumour mill points to the black sheep of the Stock clan, Matt Livers. Family members say he threatened Wayne the day before the murders. Matt says hes innocent but he fails a polygraph. After hours of intense interrogation he cracks and confesses. Matt also implicates his cousin, Nick Sampson. But two days later Matt recants and the case stalls. That is until investigators focus on a gold ring found on the kitchen floor of the farmhouse. Forensic tests find traces of the victims blood and an unknown womans DNA on the ring. When investigators trace the ring to a stolen truck in Wisconsin and teenage lovers on a drug-fuelled crime spree, suddenly detectives have four prime suspects. To make things worse, there are allegations that investigators planted evidence. Now, not only Murdock, but all of Nebraska wants to know who really murdered Wayne and Sharmon Stock.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.4.</episode-num></programme>

The Japanese simply would not surrender and continued to fight island by island, foxhole by foxhole. The US Air Force commander tried bombing Japan into submission, firebombing Tokyo. Over 200,000 people died, yet still Japan clung on. In the end, President Truman had to go nuclear, and the fates of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were sealed. The films end with Japan subdued and the revelation of Japanese war crimes. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed particularly in the last five to 10 years, when documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict. With the very latest satellite-delivered terrain mapping and state-of-the-art graphics, this story can now be told with the very latest access to information which was not previously available.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.12.</episode-num></programme>

One was hit and Capt Scott OGrady ejected. For five days, he evaded Serb forces until a fellow pilot picked up a faint signal from his emergency beacon. This is the story of his spectacular rescue by an elite Air Force and Marine Corps pilot rescue unit, a helicopter-borne force that picked up OGrady deep behind enemy lines.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.15.</episode-num></programme>

The Japanese simply would not surrender and continued to fight island by island, foxhole by foxhole. The US Air Force commander tried bombing Japan into submission, firebombing Tokyo. Over 200,000 people died, yet still Japan clung on. In the end, President Truman had to go nuclear, and the fates of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were sealed. The films end with Japan subdued and the revelation of Japanese war crimes. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed particularly in the last five to 10 years, when documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict. With the very latest satellite-delivered terrain mapping and state-of-the-art graphics, this story can now be told with the very latest access to information which was not previously available.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.12.</episode-num></programme>
