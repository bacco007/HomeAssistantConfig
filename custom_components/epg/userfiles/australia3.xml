This is his story, but it is also a chronicle of the civil rights movement in the US. We first meet Belafonte as a a young boy: born in New York and raised in Jamaica, he returns to Harlem in his early teens, where he discovers the American Negro Theater, the magic of performing and, finally, fame. However, even as a superstar, the life of a black man in 1960s America was far from easy and Belafonte was confronted with the same Jim Crow laws and prejudices that every other black man, woman and child in America was facing. This program presents a profile of the Civil Rights Movement through the eyes of an insider, who despite his high profile, wasnt afraid to spend time in the trenches.</desc></programme>

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.28.</episode-num></programme>

The neighbourhood goes on high alert while police swing into action to catch her killer. The case is a mystery. There were no signs of forced entry so Jessica must have known her attacker, but she was a model teenager with no enemies. A retrieved semen sample gives police crucial evidence - the killers DNA. But the first round of tests fails to find a match. Two months later, they get their first big break. A husband, father, and suspected serial killer is arrested in the midst of a suicide attempt. He confesses to killing four women, assaulting more than 150 women, and has an MO that matches Jessicas murder. A witness steps up to prove that the suspect had met Jessica, but he wont confess. When the suspects DNA doesnt match, Jessicas family is destroyed and posts a reward for any new leads. Five months later, a jailhouse informant fingers his cellmate for the crime. The new suspect lived nearby, was seen near Jessicas home, and refuses to give his DNA. Have the police got the right man?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.7.</episode-num></programme>

The neighbourhood goes on high alert while police swing into action to catch her killer. The case is a mystery. There were no signs of forced entry so Jessica must have known her attacker, but she was a model teenager with no enemies. A retrieved semen sample gives police crucial evidence - the killers DNA. But the first round of tests fails to find a match. Two months later, they get their first big break. A husband, father, and suspected serial killer is arrested in the midst of a suicide attempt. He confesses to killing four women, assaulting more than 150 women, and has an MO that matches Jessicas murder. A witness steps up to prove that the suspect had met Jessica, but he wont confess. When the suspects DNA doesnt match, Jessicas family is destroyed and posts a reward for any new leads. Five months later, a jailhouse informant fingers his cellmate for the crime. The new suspect lived nearby, was seen near Jessicas home, and refuses to give his DNA. Have the police got the right man?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.7.</episode-num></programme>

Until 38-year-old, single mother Natalie Antonetti is savagely beaten in her sleep. Eighteen days later, Natalie succumbs to her wounds and dies, and the investigation kicks into high gear to catch her killer. Challenged by a contaminated crime scene, the investigation starts slow. Natalies friends, Austins counter-culture musician community, want nothing to do with the police. A composite sketch of a suspicious man seen lurking outside the apartment is drawn up but no one matches the description. Its when investigators discover a vitriolic note from a spurned lover that they establish their first real suspect, Dennis Davis. A well-known recording studio owner with a boyish charm, Dennis had a rocky relationship with the victim, but he has strong ties to her son, an alibi, and doesnt match the composite sketch. Two months later, an unrelated rape pulls in a new suspect who matches the description but refuses to confess. The case suffers a major blow when the lead detective is diagnosed with cancer and dies two months later. Twenty-one years later, Austin police get a stunning phone call that turns the case red-hot and a new detective works tirelessly to serve justice and put Natalies memory to rest.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.8.</episode-num></programme>

Despite a five-year police operation that cost 5 million pounds and ate up over 2 million man hours, Sutcliffe was only caught after a chance encounter with two police constables on a routine patrol. We tell the horrific story of his reign of terror speaking exclusively to Sutcliffes own brother as well as Neil Jackson, the son of one of his earliest victims. We also talk to one of the detectives who interviewed Sutcliffe as part of the inquiry, to lay bare the mistakes that were made that allowed him to carry on killing for so long.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.3.</episode-num></programme>

Until 38-year-old, single mother Natalie Antonetti is savagely beaten in her sleep. Eighteen days later, Natalie succumbs to her wounds and dies, and the investigation kicks into high gear to catch her killer. Challenged by a contaminated crime scene, the investigation starts slow. Natalies friends, Austins counter-culture musician community, want nothing to do with the police. A composite sketch of a suspicious man seen lurking outside the apartment is drawn up but no one matches the description. Its when investigators discover a vitriolic note from a spurned lover that they establish their first real suspect, Dennis Davis. A well-known recording studio owner with a boyish charm, Dennis had a rocky relationship with the victim, but he has strong ties to her son, an alibi, and doesnt match the composite sketch. Two months later, an unrelated rape pulls in a new suspect who matches the description but refuses to confess. The case suffers a major blow when the lead detective is diagnosed with cancer and dies two months later. Twenty-one years later, Austin police get a stunning phone call that turns the case red-hot and a new detective works tirelessly to serve justice and put Natalies memory to rest.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.8.</episode-num></programme>

There were no signs of forced entry so Jessica must have known her attacker, but she was a model teenager with no enemies. A retrieved semen sample gives police crucial evidence - the killers DNA.

By 1917, the British were staring defeat in the face and focused on a ridge in the Ypres sector of Belgium to breach enemy lines. A network of 19 mines was laid under a ridge by tunnel units, a total of almost one million pounds of explosives.
