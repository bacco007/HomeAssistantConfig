Polley is both filmmaker and detective as she investigates the secrets kept by a family of storytellers. She playfully interviews and interrogates a cast of characters of varying reliability, eliciting refreshingly candid, yet mostly contradictory, answers to the same questions. As each relates their version of the family mythology, present-day recollections shift into nostalgia-tinged glimpses of their mother, who departed too soon, leaving a trail of unanswered questions. Polley unravels the paradoxes to reveal the essence of family: always complicated, warmly messy and fiercely loving. Stories We Tell explores the elusive nature of truth and memory, but at its core is a deeply personal film about how our narratives shape and define us as individuals and families, all interconnecting to paint a profound, funny and poignant picture of the larger human story.</desc></programme>

Combining conventional medical training with cutting edge alternative therapies, Dr. Martys deeply empathetic philosophy offers a vital example of how improving overall health rather than merely treating disease is transformative for all living things. As Goldstein and his staff interact with animals, the stakes are high and it is often touch and go as we watch the owners, some who have travelled great distances, struggle with the reality of whether or not their pets will live to see another day. "The Dog Doc" poses a serious question about whether we are over medicating our pets, our children, and ourselves while offering an immersive view into a seldom-seen world to paint a complete picture of the dedication of being a veterinarian.</desc></programme>

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.29.</episode-num></programme>

Judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood set three tasks to test each celebritys baking prowess, while comedian Ed Byrne is on hand to guide them through. The celebrities taking up the baking baton this time are ex-Spice Girl Geri Horner, BBC world affairs editor John Simpson, footballer and pundit Jermaine Jenas, and 1990s pop sensation Louise Redknapp. The first hurdle for the bakers is the signature challenge, where they take on savoury tarts. Up next, its the technical challenge: Marys chocolate and beetroot tray bake. The bakers must follow a stripped-back recipe to produce this moist, malty sponge, covered with a cream-cheese icing and decorated with candied beetroot. On day two, the bakers have one last chance to impress the judges in a bid to claim the Sport Relief Star Baker apron. For this final task, the showstopper bake, they attempt to make 3D models of their favourite sporting moments out of biscuits. When it comes to the crunch, who will crumble under the pressure and who will triumph to take home the title of Star Baker? While the celebrity bakers hope to inspire others to get involved in fundraising for Sport Relief, Clare Balding visits Kenya to learn about the work of Sport Relief there, and the difference the money raised is making in the fight against malaria. She visits children in hospital battling the disease and sees how donations can help prevent such suffering.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num></programme>

Italian cooking teacher Luciana Sampogna from Cucina Italiana demonstrates the lovely little pretzel-like snacks called taralli that are popular right throughout the south of Italy. Guy meets Italian-Australian family the Pizzinis, who come from Italys alpine regions and who settled in Victorias King Valley and grow exceptional Italian grape varieties.

Mildura chef Stefano Di Pieri from Stefanos restaurant, who helped to put the area on the culinary map, then shows Guy how he uses the best blood oranges and fennel in season to make a kingfish carpaccio with shaved fennel, a dish that sings with freshness and flavour. In Adelaide, one of the Central Markets favourite characters, butcher Tony Marino, invites us to join his family to cook up an exceptional Abruzzese banquet including the classic porchetta on a spit and the most unusual way of serving polenta - spread on a laminex table and served with a rich ragu.

Gregg turns his 20-tonne batch into 6.9 million bags. Along the way, he discovers that there can be up to 20 different teas in your bag and that the recipe for the blend is altered every day, measured against a standard created in 1978. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey discovers the secrets of the tea leaf in an African tea-processing plant. She learns that 40 percent of each leaf is made up of chemicals called polyphenols. She is surprised to find that white, green and black tea are all made from the same leaves. She also discovers that the bag surrounding your tea is not ordinary paper, but a highly-engineered fabric made up of hemp, wood and polypropylene. She watches as a 60km-long roll is produced, and she gets some scientific tips on making the best possible cup of tea with a tea bag. Historian Ruth Goodman investigates tea adulteration. In the 19th-century, there were eight separate factories in London which existed solely to dry and recolour used tea leaves. She discovers that it was honest John Hornim who put that right and ensured we could trust our tea. She also finds that in the military during WWII, armoured divisions had to leave the safety of their tanks to brew-up, a habit that resulted in many casualties. She climbs on board a modern-day tank to make a cup of tea with a boiling vessel, the innovation that solved this problem.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

Unbeknownst to her, Appleton was a criminal with a severe history of violence against women. Several months later Clare decided to end the relationship, but Appleton was furious and began to torment Clare at home. Although she was interviewed by police several times, Clares pleas for help went unheeded and her burnt body was discovered at her home in Salford in February 2009. Appleton had raped Clare and then strangled her to death before setting her body alight. A police man-hunt for Appleton ensued, but after 5 days he was found hanged in a derelict pub, escaping justice. After years of hard work, a group of campaigners, including Clares father, politicians and journalists, successfully launched Clares Law, a renewed version of a national scheme that allows people to find out if their partners have a history of violence.

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder. Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels. In a world exclusive, the program also includes footage as the police entered the vault for the first time.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

Unbeknownst to her, Appleton was a criminal with a severe history of violence against women. Several months later Clare decided to end the relationship, but Appleton was furious and began to torment Clare at home. Although she was interviewed by police several times, Clares pleas for help went unheeded and her burnt body was discovered at her home in Salford in February 2009. Appleton had raped Clare and then strangled her to death before setting her body alight. A police man-hunt for Appleton ensued, but after 5 days he was found hanged in a derelict pub, escaping justice. After years of hard work, a group of campaigners, including Clares father, politicians and journalists, successfully launched Clares Law, a renewed version of a national scheme that allows people to find out if their partners have a history of violence. This programme contains exclusive interviews with Clares father, Home Secretary Theresa May, and journalists and police officers instrumental in changing the law to give domestic violence sufferers "the right to know".</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.4.</episode-num></programme>

A serial sniper was on the loose, killing innocent, unsuspecting citizens as they went about their normal activities. By the time it was over, 13 people had been shot, and 11 died. This program examines the behind-the-scenes forensic tests, which led to the capture of the killers, including geographic and behavioural profiling, ballistics, crime scene animation, handwriting analysis, DNA testing and fingerprinting.

Unbeknownst to her, Appleton was a criminal with a severe history of violence against women. Several months later Clare decided to end the relationship, but Appleton was furious and began to torment Clare at home. Although she was interviewed by police several times, Clares pleas for help went unheeded and her burnt body was discovered at her home in Salford in February 2009. Appleton had raped Clare and then strangled her to death before setting her body alight. A police man-hunt for Appleton ensued, but after 5 days he was found hanged in a derelict pub, escaping justice. After years of hard work, a group of campaigners, including Clares father, politicians and journalists, successfully launched Clares Law, a renewed version of a national scheme that allows people to find out if their partners have a history of violence. This programme contains exclusive interviews with Clares father, Home Secretary Theresa May, and journalists and police officers instrumental in changing the law to give domestic violence sufferers "the right to know".</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.4.</episode-num></programme>

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze.
