Miami, once a modest, coastal, melting-pot city, was transformed almost overnight into a glitzy metropolis when it became the main point of entry for cocaine into the USA. Chronicling the drug influx of the 1970s and 80s and the resulting gang wars and violence, this is an eye-opening profile of the Miami underworld. Featuring candid interviews with key figures on both sides of the law, it paints a picture of a city overrun by drugs and warring gangs. Taking centrestage are ex-drug dealers/smugglers Jon Roberts and Mickey Munday, who lay out the structure behind the production, import and sale of cocaine, as well as providing their own reminiscences on the excessive heyday of Miamis vice. When the drug business boomed - Miami banks almost ran out of space to store cash deposits - violence inevitably followed. An inside perspective is provided by Jorge Rivi Alaya, a convicted former hit man for Griselda Blanco, the notoriously bloodthirsty Colombian godmother.</desc></programme>

Miami, once a modest, coastal, melting-pot city, was transformed almost overnight into a glitzy metropolis when it became the main point of entry for cocaine into the USA. Chronicling the drug influx of the 1970s and 80s and the resulting gang wars and violence, this is an eye-opening profile of the Miami underworld. Featuring candid interviews with key figures on both sides of the law, it paints a picture of a city overrun by drugs and warring gangs. Taking centrestage are ex-drug dealers/smugglers Jon Roberts and Mickey Munday, who lay out the structure behind the production, import and sale of cocaine, as well as providing their own reminiscences on the excessive heyday of Miamis vice. When the drug business boomed - Miami banks almost ran out of space to store cash deposits - violence inevitably followed. An inside perspective is provided by Jorge Rivi Alaya, a convicted former hit man for Griselda Blanco, the notoriously bloodthirsty Colombian godmother.</desc></programme>

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.22.</episode-num></programme>

Maeve visits the inspiring Ricupero family who settled in Jarrahdale outside Perth, where they grow vegetables on a large scale and bake 140 loaves of bread every two weeks in the huge oven they built themselves - the crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside pane di casa so adored by Italians. Guy then shows a recipe for delicious bruschetta, using day-old bread. Guy joins olive oil producer Joe Grilli from Primo Estate in McLaren Vale at harvest time and learns about mixing oils for the perfect blend. Vongole harvester Tony Petruzzelli takes us to work as he rakes waist-deep in water off Adelaides outer harbour, then Sydney chef Eugenio Maiale cooks up the classic spaghetti alla vongole, the one dish that he always keeps on his menu at his popular inner-city restaurant A Tavola. For sweets, the crunchy fried biscuit cannoli filled with fresh ricotta is close to heaven, especially when its made by second-generation Sicilian sweets master Achille Mellini from Grossi Florentino.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num></programme>

As the three-day limit approaches, the digging becomes more and more frantic as fields and gardens are overturned by the diggers trying to get to grips with the missing manor.

But as Stephanie began to look into its history, she realised that there may have been a flour mill on the site since Domesday! So she called in Tony Robinson and his sceptical team of archaeologists to help her unravel the mystery of their accidental mill. For Professor Mick Aston the prospect was too good to turn down. As the diggers get to work uncovering the whole of the 18th-century mill, Mick takes off into the landscape to look for clues form earlier centuries. He finds more than he bargained for: the whole area was awash with the telltale mill streams needed to power grind stones. As the three days progress, the dig throws up constant reminders of the importance of wheat and bread to the medieval population and of how rich millers could become. The only spanner in the works for this perfect industrial dig is the surprise discovery of an Anglo Saxon comb.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.9.</episode-num></programme>

The massive castle that dominates the shore today is a Tudor structure built on earlier foundations, and its that early castle, built by King John, that the team is looking for. Unfortunately, everything is built on top of a rock outcrop with the steepest sides the archaeologists have ever encountered, and they have to employ mountaineers to help get them and their equipment up the sheer slopes; its not an excavation for the faint-hearted. As the dig continues, shadows of that original castle are discovered and a story emerges of how Mont Orgueil came to symbolise Jersey and the Channel Islands peculiar relationship with Britain and France. It was fought over, lost, and won back again for centuries, but the massive stone walls that the team uncover ultimately proved futile against the might of gunpowder.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.7.</episode-num></programme>

Both ship and castle were part of his ground-breaking defence plans to fortify the south coast, and establish England as a naval superpower.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num></programme>

The massive castle that dominates the shore today is a Tudor structure built on earlier foundations, and its that early castle, built by King John, that the team is looking for. Unfortunately, everything is built on top of a rock outcrop with the steepest sides the archaeologists have ever encountered, and they have to employ mountaineers to help get them and their equipment up the sheer slopes; its not an excavation for the faint-hearted. As the dig continues, shadows of that original castle are discovered and a story emerges of how Mont Orgueil came to symbolise Jersey and the Channel Islands peculiar relationship with Britain and France. It was fought over, lost, and won back again for centuries, but the massive stone walls that the team uncover ultimately proved futile against the might of gunpowder.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.7.</episode-num></programme>

But as Stephanie began to look into its history, she realised that there may have been a flour mill on the site since Domesday! So she called in Tony Robinson and his sceptical team of archaeologists to help her unravel the mystery of their accidental mill. For Professor Mick Aston the prospect was too good to turn down. As the diggers get to work uncovering the whole of the 18th-century mill, Mick takes off into the landscape to look for clues form earlier centuries. He finds more than he bargained for: the whole area was awash with the telltale mill streams needed to power grind stones. As the three days progress, the dig throws up constant reminders of the importance of wheat and bread to the medieval population and of how rich millers could become. The only spanner in the works for this perfect industrial dig is the surprise discovery of an Anglo Saxon comb.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.9.</episode-num></programme>
