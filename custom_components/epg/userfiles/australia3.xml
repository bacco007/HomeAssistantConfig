It is the first full-length feature film project that is told through the eyes of the members of the Bra Boys. It is their story. It shows their success in professional big wave surfing, it explores their international reputation for hard partying and rough justice, it touches on their running battle with authorities and it shows their absolute reliance on one another to fit into a society in which they are displaced and, at times, disinterested. Narrated by Australian actor Russell Crowe, this film looks at the evolution of the suburb of Maroubra, coupled with the historical stigma associated with Australias rebellious surf community. Central to the story is the true-life struggle of the Abberton brothers - Sunny, Koby, Jai and Dakota - one charged with murdering a Sydney standover man, another pursuing a professional surf career but charged as an accessory in his brothers legal fight, another trying to hold the family together and a young brother whose inheritance is his siblings notoriety. The film uses rare archival footage blended with incredible surf vision and intimate interviews to create a story that is both compassionate and exhilarating. Being a Bra Boy is about holding your ground - about brotherhood, honour, loyalty and family, in all its forms. The film is a story of contrast involving against-the-odds success and probable failures and, ultimately, explores the legacy and hopes of this and the next generation of a uniquely Australian community.</desc></programme>

Cocaine Cowboys 2: Hustlin with the Godmother picks up where the rip-roaring original leaves off. The story of greed, drugs, sex and crime has been transported from the cocaine-coated streets of 80s Miami to 90s Oakland, where crack is the new drug of choice. Drug baroness Griselda Blanco-whose name is attached to over 250 murders-is behind bars, but thanks to her devoted toy boy Charles Cosby, her business still thrives. But when the Black Widows paranoia worsens, it seems that Cosby is destined to become yet another notch in her murderous belt. Fast-paced, gritty and terrifyingly real, this special takes us into the sleazy, cash-fuelled world of drug front-runners, and introduces us to the woman who made even the most hard-edged criminals cower.</desc></programme>

Because he knew the Marvel universe, she made him an associate producer on X-Men (2000). Thats where he met Avi Arad, then Marvel CEO, who was impressed by Feige and hired him. Although many characters had been licensed to other studios, Feige realized that Marvel still retained rights to the core members of The Avengers. Thanks to David Maisel and Arad, Marvel had the funding in place to produce their own films. If the shared universe that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had created in 1960s comic books could be replicated in movies with state-of-the-art special effects, Feige believed Marvel could become an unstoppable blockbuster generator, starting with Iron Man.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>

Marvels fanbase surged, expanding beyond young children and college kids to the public-at-large. Stan Lee and legendary comic book artist Jack Kirby made a decision that would, in time, prove to be Marvels special sauce - their titles and characters would be woven together, creating a system of tie-ins and crossovers, fleshing out a contiguous universe.

Although many characters had been licensed to other studios, Feige realized that Marvel still retained rights to the core members of The Avengers. Thanks to David Maisel and Arad, Marvel had the funding in place to produce their own films. If the shared universe that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had created in 1960s comic books could be replicated in movies with state-of-the-art special effects, Feige believed Marvel could become an unstoppable blockbuster generator, starting with Iron Man.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.23.</episode-num></programme>

Committing to this new purpose brought her initially in conflict with the Catholic Church and the Government of India. Undaunted by the obstacles and challenges of her new calling, she rose to become viewed by many as the greatest humanitarian of modern time. Letters from Mother Teresa tells the story of how this tiny figure of a woman changed hearts, lives and inspired millions. Though she herself grew to feel an isolation and an abandonment by God, she said she saw God in every human being. The movie explores the life of Mother Teresa (Juliet Stevenson) through letters she wrote to her longtime friend and spiritual advisor, Father Celeste van Exem (Max von Sydow) over a nearly fifty-year period.</desc></programme>

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.23.</episode-num></programme>
