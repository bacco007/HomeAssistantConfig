They formed a band, Joy Division. Three years later it was a matter of art, life and death. Now thirty years later, they are enjoying a larger audience and more influence than ever before with a profound legacy that resonates fiercely in todays heavily careerist music industry and over-mediated pop culture. Pieced together from archival footage as well as new interviews with the remaining band members and musical experts, Joy Division is the definitive documentary about this influential and timeless band.</desc></programme>

They formed a band, Joy Division. Three years later it was a matter of art, life and death. Now thirty years later, they are enjoying a larger audience and more influence than ever before with a profound legacy that resonates fiercely in todays heavily careerist music industry and over-mediated pop culture. Pieced together from archival footage as well as new interviews with the remaining band members and musical experts, Joy Division is the definitive documentary about this influential and timeless band.</desc></programme>

This is followed by a fast moving round of Scenes from a Hat featuring unlikely perfume scents, over caffeinated TV shows and things that dont sound right in an angry voice.

This is followed by a fast moving round of Scenes from a Hat featuring unlikely perfume scents, over caffeinated TV shows and things that dont sound right in an angry voice. After a raucous round of Party Quirks where Greg attempts to guess Waynes celebrities being sucked into a black hole, Colins underwear surveyor and Ryans hungry hummingbird, the show ends with a moving Doo Wop paying tribute to Sarah and her fatal vacuuming accident.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.2.</episode-num></programme>

The Scenes from a Hat round features terrible teachers, awful medical ads, Aishas pick up lines and things you can say at the gym but not about your partner.

Ryan and Colin use audience suggested lines to act out a Cinderella Whose Line scenario before acting out scenes from a hat including strange psychiatrists and TV shows that shouldnt be sexy.

Theres more injury to follow for him as he is hit by collateral in a lively round of Infomercial before taking part on a packed game of Scenes from a Hat where the performers act out strange bath times, bad competitions, jobs that shouldnt be done in the nude and the wrong time to say I love you. The final two games of a jam packed six game show are a brilliant re-voicing of an old movie clip in Film Dub, followed by a mind bending volleyball scene in the always incredible Sideways Scene.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.5.</episode-num></programme>

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.21.</episode-num></programme>

The four remaining teams must summon everything theyve got to make it through to the final of this tantalizingly tough patisserie competition. For their first challenge the teams must create 4 different types of petit fours, including 2 batches which are vegan. The judges will be tougher than ever and expect that each and every one of these bitesize morsels must tantalise their discerning tastebuds. For their second challenge, the teams have 5 hours to become elaborate story tellers as they create an edible table scene inspired by the theme A Teddy Bears Picnic. At the heart of their scene must be jelly based desserts to serve 40 and accompanying edible elements to help bring their story to life. At the end of the challenge, the teams will have to walk the judges through their story with a sense of wonder and as if by magic, reveal their hidden desserts under the tough gaze of judges Benoit and Cherish. By the end of the episode the three finalist teams will have been selected and the team that ranks the lowest will be going home.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.8.</episode-num></programme>

Gregg and Chris watch as they each individually do a shop in their local convenience store and its not the shop they were expecting from cashtrapped students.

He devised a system for producing synthetic carbolic acid and for wireless telegraph communication between moving trains and stations. By the time of his death, Thomas Alva Edison could lay claim to 1093 successful US patents. But perhaps his greatest invention was himself. Born to a Canadian innkeeper, Edison received his only formal education from his mother at the kitchen table. His first invention was a commercial flop, but by the time he was 35, he had become the nations most prominent celebrity inventor. Tragically, the pace of his work took a terrible toll on his private life. His first wife appears to have killed herself with a lethal dose of morphine; his second was desperately unhappy. And yet, in so many ways, Edison transformed daily life for millions of people and in the process turned himself into the most famous American in the world.</desc></programme>

He devised a system for producing synthetic carbolic acid and for wireless telegraph communication between moving trains and stations. By the time of his death, Thomas Alva Edison could lay claim to 1093 successful US patents. But perhaps his greatest invention was himself. Born to a Canadian innkeeper, Edison received his only formal education from his mother at the kitchen table. His first invention was a commercial flop, but by the time he was 35, he had become the nations most prominent celebrity inventor. Tragically, the pace of his work took a terrible toll on his private life. His first wife appears to have killed herself with a lethal dose of morphine; his second was desperately unhappy. And yet, in so many ways, Edison transformed daily life for millions of people and in the process turned himself into the most famous American in the world.</desc></programme>

But 200 years ago Derwentcote was at the heart of an iron- and steel-producing complex that fuelled the spread of empire. Over three days the team fights through the undergrowth to reveal the furnaces and forges that produced the raw materials of industry under appalling conditions. As well as their chainsaws and mechanical diggers, the archaeologists draw on an unusual resource: the memoirs of an 18th-century industrial spy who visited the site. And with the help of old records, they can even put names and trades to the people who occupied the workers cottages that once stood alongside the works. Its a story of how cottage industry gave way to the might of the industrial cities such as Sheffield, and the team uncovers the highs and lows of the working life of Derwentcote. On top of all that, Tony discovers how excited grown men can be when they get to analyse huge lumps of 200-year-old slag.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.4.</episode-num></programme>

But 200 years ago Derwentcote was at the heart of an iron- and steel-producing complex that fuelled the spread of empire. Over three days the team fights through the undergrowth to reveal the furnaces and forges that produced the raw materials of industry under appalling conditions. As well as their chainsaws and mechanical diggers, the archaeologists draw on an unusual resource: the memoirs of an 18th-century industrial spy who visited the site. And with the help of old records, they can even put names and trades to the people who occupied the workers cottages that once stood alongside the works. Its a story of how cottage industry gave way to the might of the industrial cities such as Sheffield, and the team uncovers the highs and lows of the working life of Derwentcote. On top of all that, Tony discovers how excited grown men can be when they get to analyse huge lumps of 200-year-old slag.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.4.</episode-num></programme>
