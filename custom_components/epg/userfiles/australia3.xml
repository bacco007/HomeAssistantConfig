Polley is both filmmaker and detective as she investigates the secrets kept by a family of storytellers. She playfully interviews and interrogates a cast of characters of varying reliability, eliciting refreshingly candid, yet mostly contradictory, answers to the same questions.

Polley unravels the paradoxes to reveal the essence of family: always complicated, warmly messy and fiercely loving.

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.30.</episode-num></programme>

Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts.

It produces 60 percent of all pasta made in Italy and supplies 3000 tonnes to the UK each year. Gregg traces the journey the wheat takes through a seven-storey mill and into the production zone where it is mixed with water, pushed through moulds and turned into spaghetti. Along the way, he discovers that the perfect string of spaghetti is 25cm long and examines the technology that allows them to produce 150,000km of it each day, enough to stretch round the Earth almost four times. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey discovers why the best pasta is made with durum wheat. This is a hard wheat that, when it is milled, turns into the granular yellow flour known as semolina, which translates as semi-milled. This is the essential basis of pasta as it retains its shape and texture when cooked. She also helps to harvest 15 tonnes of tomatoes, turning them into 3000L of pasta sauce. Along the way, Cherry is surprised to hear that the British habit of pairing spaghetti with bolognese outrages many Italians. She learns why different shapes of pasta are ideally paired with different sauces, and promises in future she will serve her spaghetti with a more suitable topping, like carbonara. Historian Ruth Goodman discovers that pasta arrived in Britain much earlier than we imagined. She heads to the British Library to look at a manuscript from 1390, a cookbook written for King Richard II which contains a recipe for something called lozyns. Ruth cooks up a batch and is convinced that this an early version of lasagne. She also navigates the streets of Soho armed with a 1958 restaurant guide to find out how we first fell in love with Italian food.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.1.</episode-num></programme>

It produces 60 percent of all pasta made in Italy and supplies 3000 tonnes to the UK each year. Gregg traces the journey the wheat takes through a seven-storey mill and into the production zone where it is mixed with water, pushed through moulds and turned into spaghetti. Along the way, he discovers that the perfect string of spaghetti is 25cm long and examines the technology that allows them to produce 150,000km of it each day, enough to stretch round the Earth almost four times. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey discovers why the best pasta is made with durum wheat. This is a hard wheat that, when it is milled, turns into the granular yellow flour known as semolina, which translates as semi-milled. This is the essential basis of pasta as it retains its shape and texture when cooked. She also helps to harvest 15 tonnes of tomatoes, turning them into 3000L of pasta sauce. Along the way, Cherry is surprised to hear that the British habit of pairing spaghetti with bolognese outrages many Italians. She learns why different shapes of pasta are ideally paired with different sauces, and promises in future she will serve her spaghetti with a more suitable topping, like carbonara. Historian Ruth Goodman discovers that pasta arrived in Britain much earlier than we imagined. She heads to the British Library to look at a manuscript from 1390, a cookbook written for King Richard II which contains a recipe for something called lozyns. Ruth cooks up a batch and is convinced that this an early version of lasagne. She also navigates the streets of Soho armed with a 1958 restaurant guide to find out how we first fell in love with Italian food.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.1.</episode-num></programme>

He follows the production of chocolate digestives, from the arrival of 28 tonnes of flour right through to dispatch. Along the way, he discovers that the biscuits are shaped by a bronze roller costing up to 10,000 pounds, and that the chocolate is added to the bottom not the top of the biscuits, meaning we are all eating them the wrong way up. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is on the trail of that chocolate. At the refinery in Manchester, she learns that it is transported in heated lorries kept at 50 degrees to stop it solidifying on its way to the factory. She also discovers that this is the most expensive ingredient, at around 2000 pounds per tonne. In Nottingham Universitys sensory lab, she finds scientific proof that dunking your biscuit improves its flavour and that tea is the best liquid to dunk in. Cherry takes to the streets to see if that stacks up in the real world. Historian Ruth Goodman investigates the link between biscuits and digestion. She finds references in Samuel Pepyss diary to biscuits being a cure for flatulence and digestive discomfort, and discovers that in Victorian times it was thought that biscuits could cure everything from typhoid to scarlet fever. She also takes a look at an antique biscuit baked at the beginning of the 20th century, one of Huntley and Palmers notorious army biscuits. These dry, hard biscuits were supplied as rations to five million British soldiers on the frontline in the First World War.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.2.</episode-num></programme>

The dark plot would result in only Joes death. The twisted crime became notorious for its chilling cruelty and bizarre plot which led to Singh being found guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. She was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, but was released early in 2001. A 25-year-old law student of the Australian National University, Anu Singh invited friends to two dinner parties and told them that a terrible crime would be committed. After the first dinner party, Singh made an aborted attempt to kill Joe. Her second attempt was tragically more successful, and Joe Cinque died two days later. The toxicology reports showed high levels of heroin and Rohypnol in his body. This program features interviews with those close to the case, including Joe Cinques parents Maria and Nino (who sadly passed away during the making of this program), Nino and Marias godson Robert Terrone, psychiatrist for the Crown Dr Michael Diamond, forensic psychiatrist Paul Mullen, Anu Singhs barrister Jack Pappas, Australian Federal Police officer Greg Ranse, and first responder Gina Kikos from ACT Fire and Rescue.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.4.</episode-num></programme>

April went missing while playing with her friends and was last seen getting into a vehicle near her home in Machynlleth, mid-Wales. The nation held their breath as the hours, days and weeks rolled on, in the desperate hope to find her alive. But on October 6, a local man, Mark Bridger, was charged with her abduction and murder. Investigations into his background revealed that Bridger was a prolific user of child pornography and a paedophile. After a long and distressing trial, Bridger was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison with a whole life tariff.

From Fred and Rose West to Ed Gein (The Clown Killer) and The Milwaukee Cannibal. Utilizing a combination of compelling interviews, narration, archive footage and stylized reconstruction, each episode focuses on one notorious killer and features authentic first-hand accounts of their behaviour, from detectives who ran the case, journalists who reported on the stories, relatives - and at times, survivors - alongside series experts who provide analysis. These criminologists, crime journalists and psychologists examine how the infamous killers made headlines both nationally and internationally and why they still continue to evoke fear and fascination in the public eye.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.7.</episode-num></programme>

The dark plot would result in only Joes death. The twisted crime became notorious for its chilling cruelty and bizarre plot which led to Singh being found guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. She was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, but was released early in 2001. A 25-year-old law student of the Australian National University, Anu Singh invited friends to two dinner parties and told them that a terrible crime would be committed. After the first dinner party, Singh made an aborted attempt to kill Joe. Her second attempt was tragically more successful, and Joe Cinque died two days later. The toxicology reports showed high levels of heroin and Rohypnol in his body. This program features interviews with those close to the case, including Joe Cinques parents Maria and Nino (who sadly passed away during the making of this program), Nino and Marias godson Robert Terrone, psychiatrist for the Crown Dr Michael Diamond, forensic psychiatrist Paul Mullen, Anu Singhs barrister Jack Pappas, Australian Federal Police officer Greg Ranse, and first responder Gina Kikos from ACT Fire and Rescue.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.4.</episode-num></programme>

April went missing while playing with her friends and was last seen getting into a vehicle near her home in Machynlleth, mid-Wales. The nation held their breath as the hours, days and weeks rolled on, in the desperate hope to find her alive. But on October 6, a local man, Mark Bridger, was charged with her abduction and murder. Investigations into his background revealed that Bridger was a prolific user of child pornography and a paedophile. After a long and distressing trial, Bridger was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison with a whole life tariff.

The dark plot would result in only Joes death.

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze.

For over 100 years, since the first semi-successful attempts during the American Civil War, submarine warfare had been fraught with difficulties and failure. In 1901, the Holland I was launched as the first Royal Navy submarine, and submarines have been an integral part of the navy ever since. WWII showed the first widespread use of these underwater vessels and their major advantages. Nuclear submarines roam the waters all over the world for exploration and to keep the peace. Featuring rare archive footage, stunning 3D computer graphics and rare film of the last surviving submarines, this is a privileged glimpse into the world of submarine warfare.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num></programme>

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze. Often the blaze stoked such animosities that the fires of intrigue and betrayal never went out.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.12.</episode-num></programme>

An arsenal of advanced technological weapons so secret that even today, their true uses remain a mystery. We look at the Messerschmitt 262, the first jet fighter; the V-1 flying bomb, ancestor of todays cruise missile; and the V-2, the first ballistic missile. Perhaps most extraordinary, we investigate the possibility that the Nazis were sending UFOs into the sky.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.11.</episode-num></programme>

For over 100 years, since the first semi-successful attempts during the American Civil War, submarine warfare had been fraught with difficulties and failure. In 1901, the Holland I was launched as the first Royal Navy submarine, and submarines have been an integral part of the navy ever since. WWII showed the first widespread use of these underwater vessels and their major advantages. Nuclear submarines roam the waters all over the world for exploration and to keep the peace. Featuring rare archive footage, stunning 3D computer graphics and rare film of the last surviving submarines, this is a privileged glimpse into the world of submarine warfare.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num></programme>

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze. Often the blaze stoked such animosities that the fires of intrigue and betrayal never went out.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.12.</episode-num></programme>

For over 100 years, since the first semi-successful attempts during the American Civil War, submarine warfare had been fraught with difficulties and failure. In 1901, the Holland I was launched as the first Royal Navy submarine, and submarines have been an integral part of the navy ever since. WWII showed the first widespread use of these underwater vessels and their major advantages. Nuclear submarines roam the waters all over the world for exploration and to keep the peace. Featuring rare archive footage, stunning 3D computer graphics and rare film of the last surviving submarines, this is a privileged glimpse into the world of submarine warfare.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num></programme>
