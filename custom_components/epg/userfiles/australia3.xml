So they set off for Troy with 1000 ships holding 50,000 Greeks. With the help of Achilles, the Greeks are able to fight the never-before-defeated Trojans, but they come to a stop by Hector, Prince of Troy.</desc></programme>

Assuming the blame for the death of DA Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. Everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. Even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.</desc></programme>

Believing sex is the motive and that the victim knew her killers, investigators immediately zero in on two prime suspects: Merediths 20-year-old American roommate, Amanda Knox, and her handsome Italian boyfriend. But a few weeks later, forensic evidence suggests someone else was also at the house that night. Can investigators determine who is telling the truth?

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder. Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels. In a world exclusive, the program also includes footage as the police entered the vault for the first time.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

A PhD student at the time, Griffiths was working on his doctoral thesis regarding applied criminal justice. He was charged with murdering 43-year-old Susan Rushworth, 31-year-old Shelley Armitage and 36-year-old Suzanne Blamires. Four days after Ms Blamires vanished, he was arrested. Griffiths hid a dark side from the world. He was obsessed with murder and serial killers. He had a misogynistic, vicious and violent streak, enjoying what he saw as some sort of power over prostitutes. On May 24, 2010, a caretaker at Griffiths block of flats was checking CCTV from the weekend before. What he saw was shocking. A woman could be seen running from Griffiths flat, terrified, screaming. Seconds later, he was chasing her before going out of shot. Knocking her unconscious, Griffiths dragged her back in front of the camera before firing a bolt through her head. This was Suzanne Blamires. He then deposited her body in the nearby River Aire, where officers found it the day after arresting Griffiths. Human remains were also found of Shelley Armitage, but Susan Rushworths body was never discovered. The program interviews the victims families along with those who knew Griffiths to gain some kind of insight into the man who calls himself the Crossbow Cannibal.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

A PhD student at the time, Griffiths was working on his doctoral thesis regarding applied criminal justice. He was charged with murdering 43-year-old Susan Rushworth, 31-year-old Shelley Armitage and 36-year-old Suzanne Blamires. Four days after Ms Blamires vanished, he was arrested. Griffiths hid a dark side from the world. He was obsessed with murder and serial killers. He had a misogynistic, vicious and violent streak, enjoying what he saw as some sort of power over prostitutes. On May 24, 2010, a caretaker at Griffiths block of flats was checking CCTV from the weekend before. What he saw was shocking. A woman could be seen running from Griffiths flat, terrified, screaming. Seconds later, he was chasing her before going out of shot. Knocking her unconscious, Griffiths dragged her back in front of the camera before firing a bolt through her head. This was Suzanne Blamires. He then deposited her body in the nearby River Aire, where officers found it the day after arresting Griffiths. Human remains were also found of Shelley Armitage, but Susan Rushworths body was never discovered. The program interviews the victims families along with those who knew Griffiths to gain some kind of insight into the man who calls himself the Crossbow Cannibal.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

But just who would want to kill the man described by friends as a naive and easygoing "good ole boy"? The only clue for investigators, Stevens unkempt bed, reveals he had sex with a mystery woman hours before he was murdered. A voodoo priestess, a stripper, and an ex-con make the list of possible suspects. When the investigation stalls, the victims family hires their own private investigator. After a series of false leads, the bizarre case eventually goes cold - that is, until a woman makes a sensational confession, and a sordid tale of jealousy, sex, and cold-blooded murder is finally revealed.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.11.</episode-num></programme>

With her throat slashed, Meredith Kerchers half-naked body is found in her locked bedroom. And with the case making headlines around the world, police are under tremendous pressure to find a culprit, fast. Believing sex is the motive and that the victim knew her killers, investigators immediately zero in on two prime suspects: Merediths 20-year-old American roommate, Amanda Knox, and her handsome Italian boyfriend. But a few weeks later, forensic evidence suggests someone else was also at the house that night. Can investigators determine who is telling the truth? And with a media circus raging on in the background, can they figure out who killed Meredith Kercher?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.10.</episode-num></programme>

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder. Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels. In a world exclusive, the program also includes footage as the police entered the vault for the first time.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

A PhD student at the time, Griffiths was working on his doctoral thesis regarding applied criminal justice. He was charged with murdering 43-year-old Susan Rushworth, 31-year-old Shelley Armitage and 36-year-old Suzanne Blamires. Four days after Ms Blamires vanished, he was arrested. Griffiths hid a dark side from the world. He was obsessed with murder and serial killers. He had a misogynistic, vicious and violent streak, enjoying what he saw as some sort of power over prostitutes. On May 24, 2010, a caretaker at Griffiths block of flats was checking CCTV from the weekend before. What he saw was shocking. A woman could be seen running from Griffiths flat, terrified, screaming. Seconds later, he was chasing her before going out of shot. Knocking her unconscious, Griffiths dragged her back in front of the camera before firing a bolt through her head. This was Suzanne Blamires. He then deposited her body in the nearby River Aire, where officers found it the day after arresting Griffiths. Human remains were also found of Shelley Armitage, but Susan Rushworths body was never discovered.

Rachels two-year-old son, Alex, witnessed the attack. A passer-by found Rachels body, with Alex clinging to her side, repeatedly saying, "wake up mummy, wake up." A huge police investigation followed. The police didnt have many clues as to who carried out the murder, but they centred their investigation around one man, Colin Stagg. They began Operation Edzell, later described as a honey-trap, which involved an undercover female officer, Lizzie James, feigning a five-month relationship to try to coax the truth out of Stagg.

Rachels two-year-old son, Alex, witnessed the attack. A passer-by found Rachels body, with Alex clinging to her side, repeatedly saying, "wake up mummy, wake up." A huge police investigation followed. The police didnt have many clues as to who carried out the murder, but they centred their investigation around one man, Colin Stagg. They began Operation Edzell, later described as a honey-trap, which involved an undercover female officer, Lizzie James, feigning a five-month relationship to try to coax the truth out of Stagg. By 1994 the police were convinced that they had enough evidence to send him to trial, but the judge at the Old Bailey threw the case out, saying it was the deceptive conduct of the grossest kind.

The trouble was, militarily he was a disaster. After failed attacks in North Africa and Greece, his armies were on the run. Hitler now faced a difficult choice. Did he divert troops needed at other fronts to support his ally, or did he let Mussolini fall? Hitler chose to support him - a decision that would spell disaster for both of them. Hilter would lose hundreds of thousands of troops. Mussolini would lose his life.

Their mission - to prevent German U-boats stationed there from entering the North Sea and Atlantic. Led by the cruiser HMS Vindictive, the ships headed across the English Channel, including two old ferries to be sunk at the harbour entrances. The battle that ensued proved costly, with 200 British fatalities and eight Victoria Crosses awarded for the nights action.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.8.</episode-num></programme>

The trouble was, militarily he was a disaster. After failed attacks in North Africa and Greece, his armies were on the run. Hitler now faced a difficult choice. Did he divert troops needed at other fronts to support his ally, or did he let Mussolini fall? Hitler chose to support him - a decision that would spell disaster for both of them. Hilter would lose hundreds of thousands of troops. Mussolini would lose his life. This film tells the extraordinary story of the war in North Africa and features the heroics of the tiny island called Malta as it withstood wave after wave of Nazi assault. It ends with the Allies fighting their way up Italy and Germany in retreat. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed, particularly in the last five to 10 years as documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict. With the very latest satellite delivered terrain mapping and state-of-the-art graphics, this story can now be told with the very latest access to information which was not previously available.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.5.</episode-num></programme>

After failing to deliver knockout blows at Stalingrad and Moscow, his army was now at the mercy of the vast Soviet war machine. With its huge resources and seemingly limitless numbers of men, the Red Army slowly pushed the Germans back out of Russia through Ukraine, Poland, the Balkans and Hungary. This was war on a monster scale, pitching armies of millions against each other. But it was also a war fought by small bands of partisans, men like Tito in Yugoslavia, leading guerrilla bands against Nazi forces. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed particularly in the last five to 10 years as documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict. With the very latest satellite-delivered terrain mapping and state-of-the-art graphics, this story can now be told with the very latest access to information which was not previously available.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.7.</episode-num></programme>
