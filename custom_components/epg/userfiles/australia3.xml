As charming and funny as it is thought-provoking, HAIL SATAN? offers a timely look at a group of often misunderstood outsiders whose unwavering commitment to social and political justice has empowered thousands of people around the world.</desc></programme>

Polley is both filmmaker and detective as she investigates the secrets kept by a family of storytellers. She playfully interviews and interrogates a cast of characters of varying reliability, eliciting refreshingly candid, yet mostly contradictory, answers to the same questions. As each relates their version of the family mythology, present-day recollections shift into nostalgia-tinged glimpses of their mother, who departed too soon, leaving a trail of unanswered questions. Polley unravels the paradoxes to reveal the essence of family: always complicated, warmly messy and fiercely loving. Stories We Tell explores the elusive nature of truth and memory, but at its core is a deeply personal film about how our narratives shape and define us as individuals and families, all interconnecting to paint a profound, funny and poignant picture of the larger human story.</desc></programme>

So when her boyfriend Ethan Pronce proposes in a less-than-fairytale fashion, she answers with a hesitant maybe - still holding out hope for her own Mr Darcy moment. But Harriets world is turned upside down when she wakes up inside the pages of Pride and Prejudice itself as the newly arrived American cousin of the Bennet family. Though shes instantly charmed by the famously brooding Mr Darcy, she knows he belongs with Elizabeth Bennet doesnt he? As she navigates the Regency-era world with her 21st-century sensibilities, Harriet begins to question what true romance really looks like - and whether the fantasy shes chasing is getting in the way of her real-life happy ending.</desc></programme>

It produces 60 percent of all pasta made in Italy and supplies 3000 tonnes to the UK each year. Gregg traces the journey the wheat takes through a seven-storey mill and into the production zone where it is mixed with water, pushed through moulds and turned into spaghetti. Along the way, he discovers that the perfect string of spaghetti is 25cm long and examines the technology that allows them to produce 150,000km of it each day, enough to stretch round the Earth almost four times. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey discovers why the best pasta is made with durum wheat. This is a hard wheat that, when it is milled, turns into the granular yellow flour known as semolina, which translates as semi-milled. This is the essential basis of pasta as it retains its shape and texture when cooked. She also helps to harvest 15 tonnes of tomatoes, turning them into 3000L of pasta sauce. Along the way, Cherry is surprised to hear that the British habit of pairing spaghetti with bolognese outrages many Italians. She learns why different shapes of pasta are ideally paired with different sauces, and promises in future she will serve her spaghetti with a more suitable topping, like carbonara. Historian Ruth Goodman discovers that pasta arrived in Britain much earlier than we imagined. She heads to the British Library to look at a manuscript from 1390, a cookbook written for King Richard II which contains a recipe for something called lozyns. Ruth cooks up a batch and is convinced that this an early version of lasagne. She also navigates the streets of Soho armed with a 1958 restaurant guide to find out how we first fell in love with Italian food.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.1.</episode-num></programme>

From Fred and Rose West to Ed Gein (The Clown Killer) and The Milwaukee Cannibal. Utilizing a combination of compelling interviews, narration, archive footage and stylized reconstruction, each episode focuses on one notorious killer and features authentic first-hand accounts of their behaviour, from detectives who ran the case, journalists who reported on the stories, relatives - and at times, survivors - alongside series experts who provide analysis. These criminologists, crime journalists and psychologists examine how the infamous killers made headlines both nationally and internationally and why they still continue to evoke fear and fascination in the public eye.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.6.</episode-num></programme>

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze. Often the blaze stoked such animosities that the fires of intrigue and betrayal never went out.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.12.</episode-num></programme>

For over 100 years, since the first semi-successful attempts during the American Civil War, submarine warfare had been fraught with difficulties and failure. In 1901, the Holland I was launched as the first Royal Navy submarine, and submarines have been an integral part of the navy ever since. WWII showed the first widespread use of these underwater vessels and their major advantages. Nuclear submarines roam the waters all over the world for exploration and to keep the peace. Featuring rare archive footage, stunning 3D computer graphics and rare film of the last surviving submarines, this is a privileged glimpse into the world of submarine warfare.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num></programme>

Now, medic Xand Van Tulleken and historian Raksha Dave, delve into forgotten archives and hear first hand from octogenarians and nonagenarians who lived through the Smog, to uncover the true story of what happened hour by deadly hour, and the catastrophic legacy left, even as the Smog lifted and London could breathe again.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze.

For over 100 years, since the first semi-successful attempts during the American Civil War, submarine warfare had been fraught with difficulties and failure. In 1901, the Holland I was launched as the first Royal Navy submarine, and submarines have been an integral part of the navy ever since. WWII showed the first widespread use of these underwater vessels and their major advantages. Nuclear submarines roam the waters all over the world for exploration and to keep the peace. Featuring rare archive footage, stunning 3D computer graphics and rare film of the last surviving submarines, this is a privileged glimpse into the world of submarine warfare.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num></programme>
