He was joined by The Merry Band of Pranksters, a renegade group of counterculture truth-seekers, including Neal Cassady, the American icon immortalised in Kerouacs On the Road. Kesey and the Pranksters intended to make a documentary about their trip, shooting hours of 16mm footage, but the film was never finished and the footage has remained virtually unseen ... until now. Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney and Alison Ellwood were given unprecedented access to this raw footage by the Kesey family. Working with the Film Foundation, and the UCLA Film Archives, they restored over 100 hours of film and audiotape to create the extraordinary, joyous, LSD-laced Magic Trip.</desc></programme>

Returning to his childhood home in Queensbridge, Nas shares stories of his upbringing and influences - from the music of his jazz musician father Olu Dara to the burgeoning hip-hop scene in New York City - as well as the obstacles he faced before his major label signing at age 20. Featuring interviews with his Illmatic producers (Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, L.E.S., and DJ Premier) and musical peers (including Pharrell Williams and Alicia Keys), this is a thrilling account of Nass evolution from a young street poet to a visionary MC.</desc></programme>

Returning to his childhood home in Queensbridge, Nas shares stories of his upbringing and influences - from the music of his jazz musician father Olu Dara to the burgeoning hip-hop scene in New York City - as well as the obstacles he faced before his major label signing at age 20. Featuring interviews with his Illmatic producers (Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, L.E.S., and DJ Premier) and musical peers (including Pharrell Williams and Alicia Keys), this is a thrilling account of Nass evolution from a young street poet to a visionary MC.</desc></programme>

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.25.</episode-num></programme>

From a childhood in the small town of Epworth in the North of England to a scholarly education at Oxford University, and from humble beginnings in Bristol to an influential base in London, John Wesleys impact is still felt, though not completely recognised today. John Wesley travelled England more than any other person in history. In the 1700s he established schools, medical centres and chapels as he challenged social, political and religious structures to bring about justice for the marginalised. Filmed in elegant chapels, bustling towns and historical sites in Epworth, Oxford, Bristol, Cornwall and in London, this biographical documentary follows respected teacher and commentator Keith Garner as he discovers the makings and influence of a man whose work in the 18th Century would go on to impact the Entire British Empire for over 200 years.</desc></programme>

Weeks later, Richard pronounced himself King. The boys were never seen again. For more than 500 years it has been assumed that Richard killed his nephews in a craven attempt at glory. But, some say, Richard was no child-killing monster. Rather, he was the finest King England ever had. Others say nobody killed the princes at all, and they lived anonymously into old age far away from the cut-throat world of the English court. This film explores what might have happened, interrogating all the possible culprits, and capturing the debates that rage as fiercely as ever. Fresh and incisive, this film combines compelling personal arguments with the latest evidence to present a coherent and contemporary perspective on an enduring mystery.</desc></programme>

Weeks later, Richard pronounced himself King. The boys were never seen again. For more than 500 years it has been assumed that Richard killed his nephews in a craven attempt at glory. But, some say, Richard was no child-killing monster. Rather, he was the finest King England ever had. Others say nobody killed the princes at all, and they lived anonymously into old age far away from the cut-throat world of the English court. This film explores what might have happened, interrogating all the possible culprits, and capturing the debates that rage as fiercely as ever. Fresh and incisive, this film combines compelling personal arguments with the latest evidence to present a coherent and contemporary perspective on an enduring mystery.</desc></programme>
