We first meet Belafonte as a a young boy: born in New York and raised in Jamaica, he returns to Harlem in his early teens, where he discovers the American Negro Theater, the magic of performing and, finally, fame. However, even as a superstar, the life of a black man in 1960s America was far from easy and Belafonte was confronted with the same Jim Crow laws and prejudices that every other black man, woman and child in America was facing.

This is his story, but it is also a chronicle of the civil rights movement in the US. We first meet Belafonte as a a young boy: born in New York and raised in Jamaica, he returns to Harlem in his early teens, where he discovers the American Negro Theater, the magic of performing and, finally, fame. However, even as a superstar, the life of a black man in 1960s America was far from easy and Belafonte was confronted with the same Jim Crow laws and prejudices that every other black man, woman and child in America was facing. This program presents a profile of the Civil Rights Movement through the eyes of an insider, who despite his high profile, wasnt afraid to spend time in the trenches.</desc></programme>

Now motivated by a desire to inspire and encourage others, Johns life is an example of how relinquishing control and intentionally living in the present are the keys to a successful life. As John continues to defy the odds of ALS, his courage and wisdom are uplifting countless others and providing hope in the midst of lifes trials.

Jeni: Seeking the Extraordinary is different than other youth-oriented reality TV for many reasons and will stand out as a positive, biblically-based alternative to many of the secular reality shows that depict todays youth in a negative light. It offers another option for reality TV fans that love the genre but are turned off by the reckless behaviour and non-existent values system of most secular reality-based programming.

Until 38-year-old, single mother Natalie Antonetti is savagely beaten in her sleep. Eighteen days later, Natalie succumbs to her wounds and dies, and the investigation kicks into high gear to catch her killer. Challenged by a contaminated crime scene, the investigation starts slow. Natalies friends, Austins counter-culture musician community, want nothing to do with the police. A composite sketch of a suspicious man seen lurking outside the apartment is drawn up but no one matches the description. Its when investigators discover a vitriolic note from a spurned lover that they establish their first real suspect, Dennis Davis. A well-known recording studio owner with a boyish charm, Dennis had a rocky relationship with the victim, but he has strong ties to her son, an alibi, and doesnt match the composite sketch. Two months later, an unrelated rape pulls in a new suspect who matches the description but refuses to confess. The case suffers a major blow when the lead detective is diagnosed with cancer and dies two months later. Twenty-one years later, Austin police get a stunning phone call that turns the case red-hot and a new detective works tirelessly to serve justice and put Natalies memory to rest.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.8.</episode-num></programme>

The neighbourhood goes on high alert while police swing into action to catch her killer. The case is a mystery. There were no signs of forced entry so Jessica must have known her attacker, but she was a model teenager with no enemies. A retrieved semen sample gives police crucial evidence - the killers DNA. But the first round of tests fails to find a match. Two months later, they get their first big break. A husband, father, and suspected serial killer is arrested in the midst of a suicide attempt. He confesses to killing four women, assaulting more than 150 women, and has an MO that matches Jessicas murder. A witness steps up to prove that the suspect had met Jessica, but he wont confess. When the suspects DNA doesnt match, Jessicas family is destroyed and posts a reward for any new leads. Five months later, a jailhouse informant fingers his cellmate for the crime. The new suspect lived nearby, was seen near Jessicas home, and refuses to give his DNA. Have the police got the right man?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.7.</episode-num></programme>

Until 38-year-old, single mother Natalie Antonetti is savagely beaten in her sleep. Eighteen days later, Natalie succumbs to her wounds and dies, and the investigation kicks into high gear to catch her killer. Challenged by a contaminated crime scene, the investigation starts slow. Natalies friends, Austins counter-culture musician community, want nothing to do with the police. A composite sketch of a suspicious man seen lurking outside the apartment is drawn up but no one matches the description. Its when investigators discover a vitriolic note from a spurned lover that they establish their first real suspect, Dennis Davis. A well-known recording studio owner with a boyish charm, Dennis had a rocky relationship with the victim, but he has strong ties to her son, an alibi, and doesnt match the composite sketch. Two months later, an unrelated rape pulls in a new suspect who matches the description but refuses to confess. The case suffers a major blow when the lead detective is diagnosed with cancer and dies two months later. Twenty-one years later, Austin police get a stunning phone call that turns the case red-hot and a new detective works tirelessly to serve justice and put Natalies memory to rest.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.8.</episode-num></programme>

She was sunk in the Baltic in 1945 and raised again to the surface intact in 1993. On board U-534 the treasures of World War II were preserved as if in aspic.

By 1917, the British were staring defeat in the face and focused on a ridge in the Ypres sector of Belgium to breach enemy lines. A network of 19 mines was laid under a ridge by tunnel units, a total of almost one million pounds of explosives.

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze. Often the blaze stoked such animosities that the fires of intrigue and betrayal never went out.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.5.</episode-num></programme>

Many men jumped off the ship safely, only to be consumed by flames when the aviation fuel spilled into the water and caught fire. Claiming 379 lives, many of the relatives were not told of their loved ones real fate until recently.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.4.</episode-num></programme>

Once a harbinger of death for merchant shipping and its escorts, by 1943, the British and American fleets had gained the upper hand and the U-boat had become the hunted rather than the hunter. This film features extensive footage from the Battle of the Atlantic, and of U-534 the last surviving U-boat in Western Europe. She was sunk in the Baltic in 1945 and raised again to the surface intact in 1993. On board U-534 the treasures of World War II were preserved as if in aspic. Now for the first time in over 50 years, we can experience again the claustrophobic world of the U-boats.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>
