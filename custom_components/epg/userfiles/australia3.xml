The film will unpick the events of the 2013-15 AFL seasons and ask fundamental questions about the nature of racism and discrimination in society today. Walkley award-winning writer Stan Grant and BAFTA award-winning director Daniel Gordon join forces to tell this remarkable story of one of the most decorated and celebrated players in AFL history. A man who remains a cultural hero; the very epitome of resilience and survival, who continues to fight for equality and reconciliation.</desc></programme>

In The Listening Road, youll ride along on one mans remarkable 33-day journey cycling 3,000 miles across the United States on a mission to engage with people from all walks of life in real conversations about things that matter most. As a pastor, Neil Tomba noticed a disturbing trend among people in church: they were finding it increasingly difficult to talk about God to those outside of the church. Neil wanted to practice what he preached, so he set out to bike across the United States, talking - and, more importantly, listening - to strangers from all walks of life about faith, their stories, and matters of the heart. The Listening Road takes you on Neils remarkable journey across the country and straight into its soul - from Route 66 motels to state parks, a lake house, and a railway car; from conversations with Amish farmers to chats with truckers, cowboys, mechanics, and a descendant of Daniel Boone. From one city, farm, and highway to the next, Neil models with compassion and curiosity that genuine connection happens only if we are willing to listen in love.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.7.</episode-num></programme>

Craig Martin and Earl Bridges explore Puerto Ricos Old City (Viejo San Juan) and the vibrancy of the artists who live there. Sculptor Ana Rosa Rivera talks about using art to enhance the lives of its poorest residents. Together with her husband Charles Juhasz-Alvarado, they all tour Contrafuertes, a museum in the heart of Viejo San Juan that is a collaborative artists-driven place. Artist Freddy Mercado exhibits large costumes that represent gender identity, ageing and independence. Freddy and LGBTQ rights activist/filmmaker Carla Cavina collaborated on a film telling the story of spirituality, physical suffering and identity called "Fractura." Carla explains why art and expression through film helps people struggling with their own personal identity. Earl and Craig also tour Charles and Ana Rosas art studio and learn about struggle within the longest running colony in history. The issues are messy and not clean cut, but art often presents what is broken in society in a way that doesnt necessarily provide a solution to the brokenness. For many on the island, political independence will still require positive interaction and collaboration with the United States. Most Puerto Ricans have tight bonds with family members living in the US and breaking those bonds isnt part of the equation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.6.</episode-num></programme>

Seizing on the recent death of her father that sends Kaz into an inexplicable spiral, Ferguson realises that Kaz was a victim of abuse at his hands. Ferguson uses her own troubled relationship with her father as a means of forming a closer bond with Kaz. When new Indigenous inmate Tasha is put under Doreens care, Ferguson sees an opportunity to force Kaz into action against Bea. With Maxine as acting top dog, Ferguson places Tasha in Lucys orbit and when Tasha breaks the rules by protecting herself from Lucys molestation, Maxine appears to have no choice but to punish Tasha. Ferguson urges Kaz to stand up to Maxine and save the innocent girl from abuse at the hands of a man, thereby tapping into Kazs past trauma.

Seizing on the recent death of her father that sends Kaz into an inexplicable spiral, Ferguson realises that Kaz was a victim of abuse at his hands. Ferguson uses her own troubled relationship with her father as a means of forming a closer bond with Kaz. When new Indigenous inmate Tasha is put under Doreens care, Ferguson sees an opportunity to force Kaz into action against Bea. With Maxine as acting top dog, Ferguson places Tasha in Lucys orbit and when Tasha breaks the rules by protecting herself from Lucys molestation, Maxine appears to have no choice but to punish Tasha. Ferguson urges Kaz to stand up to Maxine and save the innocent girl from abuse at the hands of a man, thereby tapping into Kazs past trauma. Bea and Allys bond is cemented when they are slotted in adjoining cells and spend hours talking.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.4.</episode-num></programme>

The first-ever conjugal visit takes place at the prison, and Boomer shamelessly attempts to impregnate herself to her deadbeat ex-boyfriend, Daz.

Seizing on the recent death of her father that sends Kaz into an inexplicable spiral, Ferguson realises that Kaz was a victim of abuse at his hands. Ferguson uses her own troubled relationship with her father as a means of forming a closer bond with Kaz. When new Indigenous inmate Tasha is put under Doreens care, Ferguson sees an opportunity to force Kaz into action against Bea. With Maxine as acting top dog, Ferguson places Tasha in Lucys orbit and when Tasha breaks the rules by protecting herself from Lucys molestation, Maxine appears to have no choice but to punish Tasha. Ferguson urges Kaz to stand up to Maxine and save the innocent girl from abuse at the hands of a man, thereby tapping into Kazs past trauma. Bea and Allys bond is cemented when they are slotted in adjoining cells and spend hours talking.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.4.</episode-num></programme>
