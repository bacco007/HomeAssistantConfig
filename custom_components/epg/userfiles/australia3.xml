Shes sorted the sentimental keepsakes - and now wants to sell the rest. Much of its bric-a-brac that will make a few dollars, but hidden in a jar is a find that could be worth thousands - an old convicts coin called a love token. Meanwhile, an old mate of Lucas has been collecting chairs from the side of the road for decades and he invited Lucas in to see if anything catches his eye. Straight away Lucas spots a classic Featherstone 70s chair. The Featherstones were Australian designers in the 60s and 70s, and their retro furniture is in high demand these days. The only problem is that the chair has a broken leg - so Lucas organises for a mate to match and fix the leg to sell it at auction. Lucas hits the road to visit the country to visit Penny and Robs place. Originally an old courthouse, its holding cells are now stacked with old wares they have been collecting for years.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>

Shes sorted the sentimental keepsakes - and now wants to sell the rest. Much of its bric-a-brac that will make a few dollars, but hidden in a jar is a find that could be worth thousands - an old convicts coin called a love token. Meanwhile, an old mate of Lucas has been collecting chairs from the side of the road for decades and he invited Lucas in to see if anything catches his eye. Straight away Lucas spots a classic Featherstone 70s chair. The Featherstones were Australian designers in the 60s and 70s, and their retro furniture is in high demand these days. The only problem is that the chair has a broken leg - so Lucas organises for a mate to match and fix the leg to sell it at auction. Lucas hits the road to visit the country to visit Penny and Robs place. Originally an old courthouse, its holding cells are now stacked with old wares they have been collecting for years.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>

Shes sorted the sentimental keepsakes - and now wants to sell the rest. Much of its bric-a-brac that will make a few dollars, but hidden in a jar is a find that could be worth thousands - an old convicts coin called a love token. Meanwhile, an old mate of Lucas has been collecting chairs from the side of the road for decades and he invited Lucas in to see if anything catches his eye. Straight away Lucas spots a classic Featherstone 70s chair. The Featherstones were Australian designers in the 60s and 70s, and their retro furniture is in high demand these days. The only problem is that the chair has a broken leg - so Lucas organises for a mate to match and fix the leg to sell it at auction. Lucas hits the road to visit the country to visit Penny and Robs place. Originally an old courthouse, its holding cells are now stacked with old wares they have been collecting for years.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>

But in the shadows lurks another story of drugs, crime, and brutal violence. The two worlds collide on Christmas Eve, 1991, when 23-year-old tourist Dana Ireland takes a bike ride through paradise that ends in tragedy. Hit by a car, raped, and left for dead on a remote trail, Danas murder devastates her family and sends ripples of fear throughout the state. Police investigate a murky world few tourists ever see but come up empty. From the get-go, the police investigation is fraught. The crime scene evidence is messy, forensic technology cant connect the dots, and most suspects or witnesses are either tight-lipped or flat-out lying. When Danas father, furious with the polices lack of results, posts a $28,000 reward for any leads, lowlife tipsters come crawling out of the woodwork and overwhelm police with false information. Lead Detective, Steve Guillermo, is certain of only one fact - a small car struck Danas bike. The search for this vehicle takes over six years but upon finding it, Guillermo starts to untangle the web of lies. Three weeks before a statute of limitations ends on the prime suspects, Guillermo gets a break that closes the case for good.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.0.</episode-num></programme>

An unidentified young woman is discovered by the side of the road, naked, raped, strangled to death, and thrown out like a piece of trash. Police have few clues but waste little time investigating this haunting crime. DNA matches the victim to 18-year-old Shannon Conway, a troubled teenage runaway who was living out of a sleeping bag among the hippies and transients on San Diegos Ocean Beach. An initial sweep zeroes in on several suspects. Tim Arman, Shannons ex-boyfriend, is still bitter that she dumped him a year ago. Keith Martin, a hobo living out of his van, is known as an angry Vietnam vet with a grudge against women. Martins van, eerily splattered with blood, was spotted in the area on the night of the murder. Police become convinced Martin is the killer but they cant forensically link him to the crime. Then a third suspect enters the frame. The day before Shannon was killed, she jumped into a pickup truck with a man she had met minutes before. Despite three strong leads, the San Diego Homicide struggle to put all the pieces together. Until over a decade later, new advances in DNA testing help cold case investigators finally find Shannons killer and give closure to her heart-broken mother.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.2.</episode-num></programme>

Twenty-nine people, including a pregnant woman and her two unborn babies, died as a result. Victims included children, Catholics and Protestants, and visitors from the Republic of Ireland and Spain. Three days after the attack, the Real IRA (RIRA) claimed responsibility. Although one man was charged and later convicted with the crime, he was released in 2005 due to evidence that the Gardai had tampered with his interview. To this day, nobody has been convicted for the crime. There have been allegations of a cover-up by the police force on both sides of the border, and of a lacklustre performance in the investigation by the then Royal Ulster Constabulary (now the Police Service of Northern Ireland). A civil case brought by members of the victims families claimed that Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were guilty of the bombings, and they were held liable for 1.6 million pounds of damages.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.2.</episode-num></programme>

Twenty-nine people, including a pregnant woman and her two unborn babies, died as a result. Victims included children, Catholics and Protestants, and visitors from the Republic of Ireland and Spain. Three days after the attack, the Real IRA (RIRA) claimed responsibility. Although one man was charged and later convicted with the crime, he was released in 2005 due to evidence that the Gardai had tampered with his interview. To this day, nobody has been convicted for the crime. There have been allegations of a cover-up by the police force on both sides of the border, and of a lacklustre performance in the investigation by the then Royal Ulster Constabulary (now the Police Service of Northern Ireland). A civil case brought by members of the victims families claimed that Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were guilty of the bombings, and they were held liable for 1.6 million pounds of damages.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.2.</episode-num></programme>

An unidentified young woman is discovered by the side of the road, naked, raped, strangled to death, and thrown out like a piece of trash. Police have few clues but waste little time investigating this haunting crime. DNA matches the victim to 18-year-old Shannon Conway, a troubled teenage runaway who was living out of a sleeping bag among the hippies and transients on San Diegos Ocean Beach. An initial sweep zeroes in on several suspects. Tim Arman, Shannons ex-boyfriend, is still bitter that she dumped him a year ago. Keith Martin, a hobo living out of his van, is known as an angry Vietnam vet with a grudge against women. Martins van, eerily splattered with blood, was spotted in the area on the night of the murder. Police become convinced Martin is the killer but they cant forensically link him to the crime. Then a third suspect enters the frame. The day before Shannon was killed, she jumped into a pickup truck with a man she had met minutes before. Despite three strong leads, the San Diego Homicide struggle to put all the pieces together. Until over a decade later, new advances in DNA testing help cold case investigators finally find Shannons killer and give closure to her heart-broken mother.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.2.</episode-num></programme>

Hit by a car, raped, and left for dead on a remote trail, Danas murder devastates her family and sends ripples of fear throughout the state. Police investigate a murky world few tourists ever see but come up empty. From the get-go, the police investigation is fraught. The crime scene evidence is messy, forensic technology cant connect the dots, and most suspects or witnesses are either tight-lipped or flat-out lying. When Danas father, furious with the polices lack of results, posts a $28,000 reward for any leads, lowlife tipsters come crawling out of the woodwork and overwhelm police with false information. Lead Detective, Steve Guillermo, is certain of only one fact - a small car struck Danas bike.

This film explodes that myth. It charts the careful planning of the campaign, the development of specialised equipment needed for the amphibious landing. It reveals the deception plan that wrong-footed Hitler. It shows how the Americans were very nearly driven off Omaha beach. If that had happened, the whole operation might have failed. The film ends with the liberation of Paris, as the Free French forces led by Charles de Gaulle marched down the streets of the capital. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed, particularly in the last five to 10 years as documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict. With the very latest satellite delivered terrain mapping and state-of-the-art graphics, this story can now be told with the very latest access to information which was not previously available.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.8.</episode-num></programme>
