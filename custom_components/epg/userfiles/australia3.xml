In The Listening Road, youll ride along on one mans remarkable 33-day journey cycling 3,000 miles across the United States on a mission to engage with people from all walks of life in real conversations about things that matter most. As a pastor, Neil Tomba noticed a disturbing trend among people in church: they were finding it increasingly difficult to talk about God to those outside of the church. Neil wanted to practice what he preached, so he set out to bike across the United States, talking - and, more importantly, listening - to strangers from all walks of life about faith, their stories, and matters of the heart. The Listening Road takes you on Neils remarkable journey across the country and straight into its soul - from Route 66 motels to state parks, a lake house, and a railway car; from conversations with Amish farmers to chats with truckers, cowboys, mechanics, and a descendant of Daniel Boone. From one city, farm, and highway to the next, Neil models with compassion and curiosity that genuine connection happens only if we are willing to listen in love.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.4.</episode-num></programme>

So when the couple decided to build their first-ever family home in the Adelaide suburb of Hillbank, it was no surprise that the city of churches would provide plenty of inspiration. Not that they want a church-like house. Neil is chasing a barn-inspired house with big, heavy timber beams. So theyve chosen to create a medieval manor built in the traditional way using methods from another time. The bones of the houses eight huge A-frames will be built by hand out of timber by a team of specialist carpenters. Thousands of timber shingles will cover the massive roof, with a two-storey high Gothic glass window the centrepiece of the house. But Neil is constantly let down by suppliers and has grossly underestimated the cost of the build, so work on the site stalls. When summer hits and temperatures soar well into the 40s, the exposed A-frame timber beams begin to warp and crack. They elect to use something straight off a warehouse floor - insulated refrigerator panels on the roof and walls - a most unlikely fit for a medieval house. Not only do they look incongruous, they are hell to work with and expensive. What ensues is a tug of war between old and new materials; between a passion for the past and unsavoury reality. With a blind faith that sees Neil try to ignore spiralling costs, he enlists the help of his family to finish his passion project, turning a build he hoped would last a few months into a five-year revelation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.3.</episode-num></programme>

The others were John Travers and Michael Murdoch. Michael Murphy, 33 at the time of the murder, was the eldest of the nine Murphy children. He had been sent to live with his grandmother at 12 years of age. His brother Gary Murphy was five years younger. Hearing impairment affected Garys schooling, and he left early to seek work. His strong interest in cars led to him facing several automotive theft-related charges in the years before the murder. He was also known to have a very violent temper. Leslie Joseph Murphy was the youngest of the Murphy children but was known as having the worst temperament. He had faced childrens court on many occasions for a number of theft-related offences and was 24 at the time of the Cobby murder. Travers was a depraved 18-year-old who had grown up in a dysfunctional family in the outer suburbs of Sydney. He mingled his blood with best mate Michael Murdoch in a ceremony that made them so-called blood brothers.

Aerial photographs and dogged local investigation suggest Dinmore Hill was once the site of a vast Iron Age hill fort and the diggers job is to find the evidence to confirm this important discovery. With the site covering some 40 acres, the team expected no shortage of targets to dig, but a frustrated geophys team initially failed to find a single satisfactory target. Undaunted, a 40-metre long trench went in to try to find the immense defensive ditch that was believed to surround the site. But as the end of day one approached, it looked like the diggers were finally beginning to get a grip on this frustrating site. And then the rain started. As trenches were shut for fear of imminent collapse, the archaeologists strive to understand the monument. There are clashes over the purpose and date of the prehistoric archaeology theyre discovering. As the soaked and tired team conclude a gruelling three-day dig, they discover a site that dominated the landscape for over a thousand years and was the ultimate statement of power and status.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">16.11.</episode-num></programme>

Aerial photographs and dogged local investigation suggest Dinmore Hill was once the site of a vast Iron Age hill fort and the diggers job is to find the evidence to confirm this important discovery. With the site covering some 40 acres, the team expected no shortage of targets to dig, but a frustrated geophys team initially failed to find a single satisfactory target. Undaunted, a 40-metre long trench went in to try to find the immense defensive ditch that was believed to surround the site. But as the end of day one approached, it looked like the diggers were finally beginning to get a grip on this frustrating site. And then the rain started. As trenches were shut for fear of imminent collapse, the archaeologists strive to understand the monument. There are clashes over the purpose and date of the prehistoric archaeology theyre discovering. As the soaked and tired team conclude a gruelling three-day dig, they discover a site that dominated the landscape for over a thousand years and was the ultimate statement of power and status.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">16.11.</episode-num></programme>

Dr Dawns in the mobile clinic on the beach, and her first patient is Russell, with a huge protrusion that hes kept under wraps for 10 years. Meanwhile, Dr Christian and Dr Pixie hit the night-time bars and clubs to find frisky young Brits. Theyre armed with a new rapid test for chlamydia, the number one sexually transmitted infection. Back in the UK, Dr Pixie sees a young woman with two wombs who wants advice on carrying a baby, and a 20-year-old with inflamed tonsils that she has to clean out with a cotton bud. Dr Dawn helps a woman whos been sitting on her embarrassing rectal prolapse for a decade, and Dr Christian tackles a worrying case of warts. The doctors also meet a woman living with an extraordinary condition that means her left leg is permanently clenched up by her hip. Finally, Dr Dawn addresses the stigma of bowel cancer - by testing her own poo for signs of the disease.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.0.</episode-num></programme>

Dr Dawns in the mobile clinic on the beach, and her first patient is Russell, with a huge protrusion that hes kept under wraps for 10 years. Meanwhile, Dr Christian and Dr Pixie hit the night-time bars and clubs to find frisky young Brits. Theyre armed with a new rapid test for chlamydia, the number one sexually transmitted infection. Back in the UK, Dr Pixie sees a young woman with two wombs who wants advice on carrying a baby, and a 20-year-old with inflamed tonsils that she has to clean out with a cotton bud. Dr Dawn helps a woman whos been sitting on her embarrassing rectal prolapse for a decade, and Dr Christian tackles a worrying case of warts. The doctors also meet a woman living with an extraordinary condition that means her left leg is permanently clenched up by her hip. Finally, Dr Dawn addresses the stigma of bowel cancer - by testing her own poo for signs of the disease.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.0.</episode-num></programme>
