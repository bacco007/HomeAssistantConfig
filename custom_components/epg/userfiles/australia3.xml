While there, she uses her free time to research the provenance of the veil, which leads her to the colourful island town of Burano, famed for its exquisitely handcrafted lace. On her way to the island she encounters a handsome man who offers help but Emma - still processing the end of a long-distance relationship - declines. Her search leads to the oldest shop on the island, where the owner responds exuberantly to the veil. Emma doesnt understand Italian but thankfully, the man she met earlier shows up and can translate. As they spend time together and Paolo helps Emma to let go and embrace the beauty of Italy, they begin falling for each other. As Emma prepares to return to Chicago, she isnt sure she can handle another long-distance relationship, but the veil and its legend may have other plans.</desc></programme>

Then the unthinkable happened. On Friday, August 16, 2013, Chris Lane set off for his afternoon jog in southern Oklahoma, a route hed run many times before, when he was gunned down from behind by three callous and bored teenage joyriders. Suffering severe internal injuries to his heart and lungs, Chris died on the side of the road. He was 22 years old. The three teenage boys, aged just 15, 16 and 17 at the time of the attack, are now behind bars. The youngest of the three, James Edwards Jr, was sentenced to 25 years as an accessory after the fact. The driver that day, Michael Jones, will spend at least 38 years in prison before he is eligible for parole. Chancey Luna, the boy who pulled the trigger, will never be released. But the full story behind this heartless crime has never been told. International award-winning journalist Mike Amor comes face-to-face with one of the killers who has shock admissions from behind prison walls about why and how he and his mates mercilessly took Chriss life.

Bormann made Hitler and the Third Reich rich through thinly veiled extortion schemes such as The Hitler Endowment Fund of German Industry. He also came up with the idea of charging royalties on Hitlers image on postage stamps - and so made his Fuhrer personally wealthy. He became so close to Hitler and the running of the war that Hitler once screamed To win this war, I need Bormann! More sinister was Bormanns involvement in ensuring the progress of the final solution. Himmler had to report to Bormann on the extermination of the Jews. Bormann, Hitlers doctor Stumpfegger and Artur Axmann (the Head of the Hitler Youth) all left the bunker in Berlin together after Hitlers suicide on 30th April 1945. After Axmann left them at the Lehrter Station Bormann and Stumpfegger disappeared. This led to one of the longest Nazi hunts in history.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>

Bormann made Hitler and the Third Reich rich through thinly veiled extortion schemes such as The Hitler Endowment Fund of German Industry. He also came up with the idea of charging royalties on Hitlers image on postage stamps - and so made his Fuhrer personally wealthy. He became so close to Hitler and the running of the war that Hitler once screamed To win this war, I need Bormann! More sinister was Bormanns involvement in ensuring the progress of the final solution. Himmler had to report to Bormann on the extermination of the Jews. Bormann, Hitlers doctor Stumpfegger and Artur Axmann (the Head of the Hitler Youth) all left the bunker in Berlin together after Hitlers suicide on 30th April 1945. After Axmann left them at the Lehrter Station Bormann and Stumpfegger disappeared. This led to one of the longest Nazi hunts in history.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>
