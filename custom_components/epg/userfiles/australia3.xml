Everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile.

They work for The Boss (God) who gives them a new assignment to complete in every episode. Lenny is always happy and ready to take on the tasks the Boss gives him. However, much like Peter in the gospels, Lenny doesnt always think before he acts and usually needs help getting out of sticky situations. But hes teachable and willing to admit when hes wrong. His two best qualities are that he loves Jesus and is a true friend to Lucy. Lucy is sweet, smart and lamb-tastic! Shes kind-hearted, loving, and aims to support everyone she meets. Inside that happy demeanor is a strong-willed, adventurous, task-oriented gal who will take on any task handed to her. But, she still has a lot to learn when it comes to being an example for others. Her two best qualities are that she takes very good care of Lenny and points everyone to Jesus.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.3.</episode-num></programme>

Rather, when people engage in doing good as an integral business mindset, again and again it leads to successful business, including better financial outcomes. Peter talks with Ian Warren from Stellen Engineering about how his willingness to start small and stay in rhythm with acts for good have helped drive success within his business. Helping to create a team that loves to work in the business because of the impact for good that it has.

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.29.</episode-num></programme>

Jennifer Saunders hosts this second episode as four celebrities face their three challenges set by judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood. The bakers on the starting line are former Labour politician Ed Balls, writer and presenter Victoria Coren Mitchell, sports commentator Chris Kamara, and singer and actor Kimberley Walsh. The bakers must make 24 identical American-style muffins for their signature challenge, football pies in the technical challenge and, finally, show-stopping tiered cakes representing an extreme sport. Interesting flavours and confusion abound in this baking battle. Who will bag the coveted title of star baker? While the bakers aim to inspire others to raise money, Denise Lewis visits a project in Tyne and Wear where she meets Linda and Hughie.

Judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood set three tasks to test each celebritys baking prowess, while comedian Ed Byrne is on hand to guide them through. The celebrities taking up the baking baton this time are ex-Spice Girl Geri Horner, BBC world affairs editor John Simpson, footballer and pundit Jermaine Jenas, and 1990s pop sensation Louise Redknapp. The first hurdle for the bakers is the signature challenge, where they take on savoury tarts. Up next, its the technical challenge: Marys chocolate and beetroot tray bake. The bakers must follow a stripped-back recipe to produce this moist, malty sponge, covered with a cream-cheese icing and decorated with candied beetroot. On day two, the bakers have one last chance to impress the judges in a bid to claim the Sport Relief Star Baker apron. For this final task, the showstopper bake, they attempt to make 3D models of their favourite sporting moments out of biscuits. When it comes to the crunch, who will crumble under the pressure and who will triumph to take home the title of Star Baker? While the celebrity bakers hope to inspire others to get involved in fundraising for Sport Relief, Clare Balding visits Kenya to learn about the work of Sport Relief there, and the difference the money raised is making in the fight against malaria. She visits children in hospital battling the disease and sees how donations can help prevent such suffering.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num></programme>

Guy meets Italian-Australian family the Pizzinis, who come from Italys alpine regions and who settled in Victorias King Valley and grow exceptional Italian grape varieties.

When several bodies were discovered buried in the back garden of their Gloucester home in 1994, a media furor surrounded the couple after it was learned that most of their victims, which included two of their own children, died following episodes of sadistic rape and torture. Whilst Fred was first held accountable as the instigator, we highlight new information which uncovers Rose as a cold-blooded killer single-handedly guilty of several murders of her own. Featuring exclusive interviews with Roses solicitor, surviving victim Caroline Roberts and the man who led the investigation, former Detective Superintendent John Bennett. As Rose West serves her life sentence in prison, 2014 marks the 20th anniversary of the first body discovered at the family home.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.2.</episode-num></programme>

When several bodies were discovered buried in the back garden of their Gloucester home in 1994, a media furor surrounded the couple after it was learned that most of their victims, which included two of their own children, died following episodes of sadistic rape and torture. Whilst Fred was first held accountable as the instigator, we highlight new information which uncovers Rose as a cold-blooded killer single-handedly guilty of several murders of her own. Featuring exclusive interviews with Roses solicitor, surviving victim Caroline Roberts and the man who led the investigation, former Detective Superintendent John Bennett. As Rose West serves her life sentence in prison, 2014 marks the 20th anniversary of the first body discovered at the family home.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.2.</episode-num></programme>

Yet few people know that somewhere in the grounds once stood one of Englands richest abbeys, founded by Henry V. The abbey finally fell foul of Henry VIII in 1539, but what might be left? Despite its central role in the conflicts between church and state throughout the 16th century, very little is known about Syon Abbey. What sort of layout did it have? How big was it? Early results from the dig are both exciting and confusing but, amidst much argument, the team slowly build a picture of what was once a truly extraordinary building.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">10.0.</episode-num></programme>

These new warriors of the air were to make critical contributions to some of the most famous battles of the conflict. The indomitable German paratroopers, the Fallschirmjager, established an enduring legend with their dogged defence of Monte Cassino. The Allies were quick to imitate their deadly enemy: the Fallschirmjager were the inspiration, the British Paratroop Battalions and Americans Screaming Eagles were the result.
