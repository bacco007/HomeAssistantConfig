The seven-metres wide convoy takes up the whole road which makes passing in other vehicles a high-risk manoeuvre. Only the toughest of truckers brave the brutal conditions of Queenslands Cape York Peninsula. After years of hard graft on remote cattle stations. Sharon Collins is no stranger to the harsh conditions of the outback, and this years drought has left the station struggling to feed their cattle. House mover Robbie Mackay has a gruelling 14-hour shift ahead of him, shifting two homes simultaneously, from two different locations, and both are heading to the same remote outback cattle station. Robbies permit allows him to move the houses on public roads overnight. But both houses need to make it to their destination by 10am or risk being stopped.

The seven-metres wide convoy takes up the whole road which makes passing in other vehicles a high-risk manoeuvre. Only the toughest of truckers brave the brutal conditions of Queenslands Cape York Peninsula. After years of hard graft on remote cattle stations. Sharon Collins is no stranger to the harsh conditions of the outback, and this years drought has left the station struggling to feed their cattle. House mover Robbie Mackay has a gruelling 14-hour shift ahead of him, shifting two homes simultaneously, from two different locations, and both are heading to the same remote outback cattle station. Robbies permit allows him to move the houses on public roads overnight. But both houses need to make it to their destination by 10am or risk being stopped. Time is running out.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">7.2.</episode-num></programme>

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.28.</episode-num></programme>

The neighbourhood goes on high alert while police swing into action to catch her killer. The case is a mystery. There were no signs of forced entry so Jessica must have known her attacker, but she was a model teenager with no enemies. A retrieved semen sample gives police crucial evidence - the killers DNA. But the first round of tests fails to find a match. Two months later, they get their first big break. A husband, father, and suspected serial killer is arrested in the midst of a suicide attempt. He confesses to killing four women, assaulting more than 150 women, and has an MO that matches Jessicas murder. A witness steps up to prove that the suspect had met Jessica, but he wont confess. When the suspects DNA doesnt match, Jessicas family is destroyed and posts a reward for any new leads. Five months later, a jailhouse informant fingers his cellmate for the crime. The new suspect lived nearby, was seen near Jessicas home, and refuses to give his DNA. Have the police got the right man?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.7.</episode-num></programme>

There were no signs of forced entry so Jessica must have known her attacker, but she was a model teenager with no enemies. A retrieved semen sample gives police crucial evidence - the killers DNA. But the first round of tests fails to find a match. Two months later, they get their first big break. A husband, father, and suspected serial killer is arrested in the midst of a suicide attempt. He confesses to killing four women, assaulting more than 150 women, and has an MO that matches Jessicas murder. A witness steps up to prove that the suspect had met Jessica, but he wont confess. When the suspects DNA doesnt match, Jessicas family is destroyed and posts a reward for any new leads. Five months later, a jailhouse informant fingers his cellmate for the crime.

Law enforcement launches the states biggest manhunt in history but finds Adams severed head two weeks later. Police make it their mission to track down his killer. But a tragic stream of errors mars the investigation. Hollywood PD pins a close family friend as a prime suspect but they have no evidence.

Utilizing a combination of compelling interviews, narration, archive footage and stylized reconstruction, each episode focuses on one notorious killer and features authentic first-hand accounts of their behaviour, from detectives who ran the case, journalists who reported on the stories, relatives - and at times, survivors - alongside series experts who provide analysis. These criminologists, crime journalists and psychologists examine how the infamous killers made headlines both nationally and internationally and why they still continue to evoke fear and fascination in the public eye.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.0.</episode-num></programme>

But after the flames were put out, investigators discovered the pair had been stabbed to death before arson consumed their home. The town drunk and a local nursing aide soon fingered two men as the killers, among them, Randy Steidl. Even Steidls brother, an Illinois cop, thought he was guilty, and Randy received the death penalty. But when Michael Callahan, a promising young cop with the Illinois State Police, started looking at the case, he encountered lies, corruption and evidence of guilt pointing to just about everyone in Illinois except Randy Steidl. Even after Callahans bosses tried to silence him, he pursued the case - costing him his job, but eventually helping free Randy Steidl from death row.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.3.</episode-num></programme>

He said he had buried Aston in a shallow grave in scrubland about 60km south, over the New South Wales border near the seaside hamlet of Kingscliff. Belita Ryan immediately rang the police, and Terry retold his story to detectives of the Queensland Criminal Investigation branch. At approximately 4:45am, May 5, the detectives drove Terry and his mother over the border into New South Wales.

Once a harbinger of death for merchant shipping and its escorts, by 1943, the British and American fleets had gained the upper hand and the U-boat had become the hunted rather than the hunter. This film features extensive footage from the Battle of the Atlantic, and of U-534 the last surviving U-boat in Western Europe. She was sunk in the Baltic in 1945 and raised again to the surface intact in 1993. On board U-534 the treasures of World War II were preserved as if in aspic. Now for the first time in over 50 years, we can experience again the claustrophobic world of the U-boats.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>
