The mosaics hint at a grand villa, but as this part of Somerset has been in constant use by the army for the last century and a half, no-one has ever had a chance to really see whats under the ground. To everyones surprise, the initial results suggest theres been more than one villa on this site. Over the following days a story emerges of the highs and lows of Roman life in Britain, from the grand rooms used for entertaining to the pitiful lives of the slaves who lived on the edge of this high society. The archaeology is impressive, but the weathers not, and as the temperatures plummet, the team hold a crisis meeting. Could this be the first time in the programs history that the conditions force the diggers to down tools?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.2.</episode-num></programme>

The archaeologists have never investigated anything like this before and must apply all their skills to make sense of a site now reclaimed by a forest. Its soon clear that the gun emplacements are part of a much bigger, complex fortified settlement that was home to hundreds of German soldiers equipped with a vast array of weapons. And, unlike with older sites, the team can talk to people who witnessed life under the occupation firsthand. What emerges is the shocking story of a fortress island where German installations were built by slave labour and the local population began to starve as the war continued. Of terrible conditions that seem more fitting to the eras the team usually investigate rather than just 70 years ago. Over three days, the team uncovers a fascinating and frequently horrifying glimpse of life during war.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.3.</episode-num></programme>

The mosaics hint at a grand villa, but as this part of Somerset has been in constant use by the army for the last century and a half, no-one has ever had a chance to really see whats under the ground. To everyones surprise, the initial results suggest theres been more than one villa on this site. Over the following days a story emerges of the highs and lows of Roman life in Britain, from the grand rooms used for entertaining to the pitiful lives of the slaves who lived on the edge of this high society. The archaeology is impressive, but the weathers not, and as the temperatures plummet, the team hold a crisis meeting.

The archaeologists have never investigated anything like this before and must apply all their skills to make sense of a site now reclaimed by a forest. Its soon clear that the gun emplacements are part of a much bigger, complex fortified settlement that was home to hundreds of German soldiers equipped with a vast array of weapons. And, unlike with older sites, the team can talk to people who witnessed life under the occupation firsthand. What emerges is the shocking story of a fortress island where German installations were built by slave labour and the local population began to starve as the war continued. Of terrible conditions that seem more fitting to the eras the team usually investigate rather than just 70 years ago. Over three days, the team uncovers a fascinating and frequently horrifying glimpse of life during war.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.3.</episode-num></programme>
