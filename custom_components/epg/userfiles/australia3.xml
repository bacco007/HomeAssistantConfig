Two emerging nations begin to clash after Paris, the Trojan prince, convinces Helen, Queen of Sparta, to leave her husband Menelaus, and sail with him back to Troy. After Menelaus finds out that his wife was taken by the Trojans, he asks his brother Agamemnon to help him get her back. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity for power. So they set off for Troy with 1000 ships holding 50,000 Greeks. With the help of Achilles, the Greeks are able to fight the never-before-defeated Trojans, but they come to a stop by Hector, Prince of Troy.</desc></programme>

Discovered in a Detroit bar in the late 60s by two celebrated producers struck by his soulful melodies and prophetic lyrics, they recorded an album which they believed would secure his reputation as the greatest recording artist of his generation. In fact, the album bombed and the singer disappeared into obscurity amid rumours of a gruesome on-stage suicide. But a bootleg recording found its way into apartheid South Africa and, over the next two decades, he became a phenomenon. The film follows the story of two South African fans who set out to find out what really happened to their hero. Their investigation leads them to a story more extraordinary than any of the existing myths about the artist known as Rodriguez.</desc></programme>

Discovered in a Detroit bar in the late 60s by two celebrated producers struck by his soulful melodies and prophetic lyrics, they recorded an album which they believed would secure his reputation as the greatest recording artist of his generation. In fact, the album bombed and the singer disappeared into obscurity amid rumours of a gruesome on-stage suicide. But a bootleg recording found its way into apartheid South Africa and, over the next two decades, he became a phenomenon. The film follows the story of two South African fans who set out to find out what really happened to their hero. Their investigation leads them to a story more extraordinary than any of the existing myths about the artist known as Rodriguez.</desc></programme>

In this spinoff series, featuring the dynamic characters at Ricks workplace, viewers will watch a variety of objects be bought, bartered and transformed, learning the process of restoration; how do you duplicate Coke machine red?

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.22.</episode-num></programme>

While there, she uses her free time to research the provenance of the veil, which leads her to the colourful island town of Burano, famed for its exquisitely handcrafted lace. On her way to the island she encounters a handsome man who offers help but Emma - still processing the end of a long-distance relationship - declines. Her search leads to the oldest shop on the island, where the owner responds exuberantly to the veil. Emma doesnt understand Italian but thankfully, the man she met earlier shows up and can translate. As they spend time together and Paolo helps Emma to let go and embrace the beauty of Italy, they begin falling for each other. As Emma prepares to return to Chicago, she isnt sure she can handle another long-distance relationship, but the veil and its legend may have other plans.</desc></programme>

But as Stephanie began to look into its history, she realised that there may have been a flour mill on the site since Domesday! So she called in Tony Robinson and his sceptical team of archaeologists to help her unravel the mystery of their accidental mill. For Professor Mick Aston the prospect was too good to turn down. As the diggers get to work uncovering the whole of the 18th-century mill, Mick takes off into the landscape to look for clues form earlier centuries. He finds more than he bargained for: the whole area was awash with the telltale mill streams needed to power grind stones. As the three days progress, the dig throws up constant reminders of the importance of wheat and bread to the medieval population and of how rich millers could become.

But as Stephanie began to look into its history, she realised that there may have been a flour mill on the site since Domesday! So she called in Tony Robinson and his sceptical team of archaeologists to help her unravel the mystery of their accidental mill. For Professor Mick Aston the prospect was too good to turn down. As the diggers get to work uncovering the whole of the 18th-century mill, Mick takes off into the landscape to look for clues form earlier centuries. He finds more than he bargained for: the whole area was awash with the telltale mill streams needed to power grind stones. As the three days progress, the dig throws up constant reminders of the importance of wheat and bread to the medieval population and of how rich millers could become.
