She has shot the rich and famous, the profound and powerful, the exceptional and notorious. Her camera has documented the horrors of war - most recently in Sarajevo and Rwanda. Masterful at exposing her photographic subjects, Annies own life has been private and protected. In this film, she made the decision to bare her artistic process, her personal journey and her delicate balancing of fame and family to the camera - a camera that is being vigilantly pointed by a filmmaker who is her younger sister. From her hectic studio to her idyllic farm, we will experience Annies current work and the creation of her latest retrospective book; we will face her losses as well as her grand successes.</desc></programme>

She has shot the rich and famous, the profound and powerful, the exceptional and notorious. Her camera has documented the horrors of war - most recently in Sarajevo and Rwanda. Masterful at exposing her photographic subjects, Annies own life has been private and protected. In this film, she made the decision to bare her artistic process, her personal journey and her delicate balancing of fame and family to the camera - a camera that is being vigilantly pointed by a filmmaker who is her younger sister. From her hectic studio to her idyllic farm, we will experience Annies current work and the creation of her latest retrospective book; we will face her losses as well as her grand successes.</desc></programme>

The Harrisons live and breathe the pawning business, using their sharp-eyed skills to carefully assess the value of items their colourful customers bring in. Ranging from the obscure to the truly historic, they must decide what an object is worth and find the story behind it. Watch as the Harrison family attempts to find the gems and bust the fakes. In this episode, Rick stumbles upon what could be one of the first Barbie dolls ever made while visiting his good friend, Marie Osmond, backstage at her long-running Vegas show. Will it turn out to be the real deal or is the seller just playing make believe? Then, Corey cant believe how well Chumlee can drive a tiny amusement park car, and he also cant believe how much the seller wants for it.

ACC.au"><title>PowerPoint with Jack Graham</title><desc>PowerPoint Ministries started as a vision of Dr Jack Graham and his wife, Deb, 20 years ago. They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts.

Darkness has fallen over Europe, and the boots of the Third Reich echo through the streets. But on a quiet city corner in the Netherlands, some choose to resist. Corrie Ten Boom and her family risk everything to hide Jewish refugees by the hundreds, and they ultimately face the consequences when they are discovered. The Hiding Place is their story - a story of faith, hope, love, and forgiveness in the face of unthinkable evil. This powerful presentation was adapted for the stage by AS Peterson, directed for the stage by Matt Logan, and filmed in Nashville, Tennessee.</desc></programme>

However, not all goes according to plan. In spite of the alleged size of the building, the diggers cant find anything. The tensions rise as a hardy bunch of diggers battle the trees and undergrowth covering the mystery building, while the rest of the team turn their attention to the pristine lawns of Litlington. After three days, the team and the villagers discover the truth about Roman Litlington and not only find the missing villa, but also the remains of an ornate Roman cemetery.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">16.10.</episode-num></programme>

In August 1943 the Romanians, no doubt prompted by merciless Allied bombing, overthrew their leader Antonescu and changed sides. Thereafter, events moved swiftly, the Russians soon captured the vital Pleosti oilfields, a huge loss to the German war effort, and within days the Soviets had taken Bucharest itself. A nervous Bulgaria sued for peace with the Allies, but the Russians pushed on into Sofia. Despite the German delaying tactics, Hungary fell next, although there were reinforcements from Axis troops stationed in Greece and Yugoslavia. In Yugoslavia itself the Germans held on grimly to Belgrade until October.

The great battle between the Italian Navy and Britains vastly outnumbered Royal Navy dominated the seas during the early years of the war as both sides sought to support the land campaigns in Egypt and East Africa. At the same time, Britain struggled to maintain its toehold on Malta to ensure that the French fleet did not fall into the hands of the Axis powers. This episode also explores the story of the war in Greece, which was invaded by the Italians in 1940, the Germans in 1941 and finally by the British in 1944. It looks at the constant fight against the German Luftwaffe, which arrived in the Mediterranean in 1941 and did terrible damage to Allied shipping, resulting on the loss of bases in North Africa. The programme also delves into the fascinating story of Operation Mercury, German invasion of Crete, the bloody battle which cost more than 10,000 lives and of the fight for the island of Sicily in 1943, which saw the miraculous evacuation of some 100,000 Axis troops.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.5.</episode-num></programme>

Theyve been invited to Norman Cross in rural Cambridgeshire to unearth the remains of the worlds first prisoner of war camp: a huge complex built by the British in 1797 to incarcerate 7000 Napoleonic soldiers and sailors. The camps design was groundbreaking, a far cry from the disease-ridden prison hulks previously used, but as the dig progresses, the team uncover a story worthy of a movie. It was a camp blighted by death, brutality and thousands of prisoners on the make. The archaeologists uncover rare examples of crafts that made some of the French inmates very rich men and evidence of gambling that left others penniless and naked. But in among the boys own stories, the diggers have a grimmer and more important task: to find the last resting place of almost 2000 prisoners who died of disease at Norman Cross. Mysteriously the location of their graves has been lost and with few historical documents the team must rely on their archaeological skills to find the cemetery. What they discover takes them all by surprise.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">16.9.</episode-num></programme>

The great battle between the Italian Navy and Britains vastly outnumbered Royal Navy dominated the seas during the early years of the war as both sides sought to support the land campaigns in Egypt and East Africa. At the same time, Britain struggled to maintain its toehold on Malta to ensure that the French fleet did not fall into the hands of the Axis powers. This episode also explores the story of the war in Greece, which was invaded by the Italians in 1940, the Germans in 1941 and finally by the British in 1944. It looks at the constant fight against the German Luftwaffe, which arrived in the Mediterranean in 1941 and did terrible damage to Allied shipping, resulting on the loss of bases in North Africa. The programme also delves into the fascinating story of Operation Mercury, German invasion of Crete, the bloody battle which cost more than 10,000 lives and of the fight for the island of Sicily in 1943, which saw the miraculous evacuation of some 100,000 Axis troops.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.5.</episode-num></programme>
