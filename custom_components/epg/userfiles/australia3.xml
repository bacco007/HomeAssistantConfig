Among the treasures are old Furphy water carts that sell for thousands of dollars, original farm tools and other classic items.

Now his widow and family think its time to clear the yard, so they set about the biggest yard sale in the country! Among the treasures are old Furphy water carts that sell for thousands of dollars, original farm tools and other classic items. Lucas is in his element as people travel from all over Australia to snap up the goods. One of the tricks of Lucas trade is to know whats a bargain, and how to up-sell it to pull in big money. Often the op shops have great items massively under-priced, so he decides to help out his local St Vincent de Paul shop by selecting some items off the shelf and seeing if he can make them big money - and he finds some nice little earners! Meanwhile, old Frank has an eve older MG sitting in his garage rusting away - so Lucas convinces him to get rid of it, freeing him up space and making some cash!</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.5.</episode-num></programme>

Now his widow and family think its time to clear the yard, so they set about the biggest yard sale in the country! Among the treasures are old Furphy water carts that sell for thousands of dollars, original farm tools and other classic items.

For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. Everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. Even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.</desc></programme>

This can cause a major paradigm shift as people reevaluate everything in their life including their belief system, relationships, what they value and how they approach daily life. Being confronted with pain, death or the threat of life can force someone to reassess their understanding and worldview as well as reconsider what is truly important. It shakes up the why and what we live for everyday and can propel a person into a new way of being and interacting with the world.

That is, until gunfire rips through two city parks popular for cruising, leaving two men dead and one critically wounded. Police race to determine a connection between the cases and a motive for the murders. The investigation is complicated. The crime scenes are messy. The media attention is glaring. The second victim is a former state senator embroiled in an FBI investigation for fraud. Detectives wonder if an embittered foe sought revenge or if it was the victims homosexuality that made him a target. After a composite sketch is released and a ballistics report confirms that the same type of gun executed both murders, a key suspect is fingered.

The police rush to establish motive and solve the towns first murders in over a century. The CSI unit combs the scene and finds nothing valuable is missing. However, blood splatter analysis shows they are looking for more than one killer. The family rumour mill points to the black sheep of the Stock clan, Matt Livers. Family members say he threatened Wayne the day before the murders. Matt says hes innocent but he fails a polygraph. After hours of intense interrogation he cracks and confesses. Matt also implicates his cousin, Nick Sampson. But two days later Matt recants and the case stalls. That is until investigators focus on a gold ring found on the kitchen floor of the farmhouse. Forensic tests find traces of the victims blood and an unknown womans DNA on the ring. When investigators trace the ring to a stolen truck in Wisconsin and teenage lovers on a drug-fuelled crime spree, suddenly detectives have four prime suspects.

The police rush to establish motive and solve the towns first murders in over a century. The CSI unit combs the scene and finds nothing valuable is missing. However, blood splatter analysis shows they are looking for more than one killer. The family rumour mill points to the black sheep of the Stock clan, Matt Livers. Family members say he threatened Wayne the day before the murders. Matt says hes innocent but he fails a polygraph. After hours of intense interrogation he cracks and confesses. Matt also implicates his cousin, Nick Sampson. But two days later Matt recants and the case stalls. That is until investigators focus on a gold ring found on the kitchen floor of the farmhouse. Forensic tests find traces of the victims blood and an unknown womans DNA on the ring. When investigators trace the ring to a stolen truck in Wisconsin and teenage lovers on a drug-fuelled crime spree, suddenly detectives have four prime suspects. To make things worse, there are allegations that investigators planted evidence. Now, not only Murdock, but all of Nebraska wants to know who really murdered Wayne and Sharmon Stock.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.4.</episode-num></programme>

Born in Stirling Castle in 1594, he was the eldest son and heir of King James the VI and I of the United Kingdom. From an early age, the young prince was hidden away by the King for security reasons; but later, after he joined his father in England as the first Scottish Prince of Wales, Henry became a mesmerising star of the first decade of the Stuart dynastys rule over the tumultuous 1600s. Paul begins his quest in Stirling Castle and meets historian and author, Sarah Fraser, who helps to uncover Henrys early life, as well as learning about how the lost princes legacy changed history when the British Empire took its first steps into North America, under Henrys patronage. This detective story, reveals the tragedy of Henrys lost potential, as this forgotten figure is brought from the shadows of history into the light of the modern world and how ultimately, his brother, Charles I ended up as King.</desc></programme>

The Japanese simply would not surrender and continued to fight island by island, foxhole by foxhole. The US Air Force commander tried bombing Japan into submission, firebombing Tokyo. Over 200,000 people died, yet still Japan clung on. In the end, President Truman had to go nuclear, and the fates of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were sealed. The films end with Japan subdued and the revelation of Japanese war crimes. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed particularly in the last five to 10 years, when documents, files and photographs have been released.

Born in Stirling Castle in 1594, he was the eldest son and heir of King James the VI and I of the United Kingdom. From an early age, the young prince was hidden away by the King for security reasons; but later, after he joined his father in England as the first Scottish Prince of Wales, Henry became a mesmerising star of the first decade of the Stuart dynastys rule over the tumultuous 1600s. Paul begins his quest in Stirling Castle and meets historian and author, Sarah Fraser, who helps to uncover Henrys early life, as well as learning about how the lost princes legacy changed history when the British Empire took its first steps into North America, under Henrys patronage. This detective story, reveals the tragedy of Henrys lost potential, as this forgotten figure is brought from the shadows of history into the light of the modern world and how ultimately, his brother, Charles I ended up as King.</desc></programme>
