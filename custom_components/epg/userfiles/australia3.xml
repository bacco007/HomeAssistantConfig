He was joined by The Merry Band of Pranksters, a renegade group of counterculture truth-seekers, including Neal Cassady, the American icon immortalised in Kerouacs On the Road. Kesey and the Pranksters intended to make a documentary about their trip, shooting hours of 16mm footage, but the film was never finished and the footage has remained virtually unseen ... until now. Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney and Alison Ellwood were given unprecedented access to this raw footage by the Kesey family. Working with the Film Foundation, and the UCLA Film Archives, they restored over 100 hours of film and audiotape to create the extraordinary, joyous, LSD-laced Magic Trip.</desc></programme>

That controversy was swiftly followed up with a series of antisemitic statements on social media. With his dangerous statements making global headlines, Ye doubled down by sharing dangerous and inflammatory mistruths during a series of interviews. In the face of backlash, Ye told the paparazzi that he was planning to run for president of the United States in 2024. Unfolding against the backdrop of Yes recent behaviour and his rumoured 2024 presidential campaign, this documentary sees award-winning journalist Mobeen Azhar travel to the United States to try and discover how one of Americas most celebrated artists became a megaphone for hate and division.</desc></programme>

That controversy was swiftly followed up with a series of antisemitic statements on social media. With his dangerous statements making global headlines, Ye doubled down by sharing dangerous and inflammatory mistruths during a series of interviews. In the face of backlash, Ye told the paparazzi that he was planning to run for president of the United States in 2024. Unfolding against the backdrop of Yes recent behaviour and his rumoured 2024 presidential campaign, this documentary sees award-winning journalist Mobeen Azhar travel to the United States to try and discover how one of Americas most celebrated artists became a megaphone for hate and division.</desc></programme>

Maeve visits the inspiring Ricupero family who settled in Jarrahdale outside Perth, where they grow vegetables on a large scale and bake 140 loaves of bread every two weeks in the huge oven they built themselves - the crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside pane di casa so adored by Italians. Guy then shows a recipe for delicious bruschetta, using day-old bread. Guy joins olive oil producer Joe Grilli from Primo Estate in McLaren Vale at harvest time and learns about mixing oils for the perfect blend. Vongole harvester Tony Petruzzelli takes us to work as he rakes waist-deep in water off Adelaides outer harbour, then Sydney chef Eugenio Maiale cooks up the classic spaghetti alla vongole, the one dish that he always keeps on his menu at his popular inner-city restaurant A Tavola. For sweets, the crunchy fried biscuit cannoli filled with fresh ricotta is close to heaven, especially when its made by second-generation Sicilian sweets master Achille Mellini from Grossi Florentino.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num></programme>
