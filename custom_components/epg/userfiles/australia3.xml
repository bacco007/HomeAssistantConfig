So is that such a big deal? Well, for Andys buds at the store, it sure is. Although they think hes a bit of an oddball, theres certainly a planet full of stranger (and homelier) guys whove at least had one go at having a go.

Miami, once a modest, coastal, melting-pot city, was transformed almost overnight into a glitzy metropolis when it became the main point of entry for cocaine into the USA. Chronicling the drug influx of the 1970s and 80s and the resulting gang wars and violence, this is an eye-opening profile of the Miami underworld. Featuring candid interviews with key figures on both sides of the law, it paints a picture of a city overrun by drugs and warring gangs. Taking centrestage are ex-drug dealers/smugglers Jon Roberts and Mickey Munday, who lay out the structure behind the production, import and sale of cocaine, as well as providing their own reminiscences on the excessive heyday of Miamis vice. When the drug business boomed - Miami banks almost ran out of space to store cash deposits - violence inevitably followed. An inside perspective is provided by Jorge Rivi Alaya, a convicted former hit man for Griselda Blanco, the notoriously bloodthirsty Colombian godmother.</desc></programme>

Discovered in a Detroit bar in the late 60s by two celebrated producers struck by his soulful melodies and prophetic lyrics, they recorded an album which they believed would secure his reputation as the greatest recording artist of his generation. In fact, the album bombed and the singer disappeared into obscurity amid rumours of a gruesome on-stage suicide. But a bootleg recording found its way into apartheid South Africa and, over the next two decades, he became a phenomenon. The film follows the story of two South African fans who set out to find out what really happened to their hero.

It would be the start of Bob Rogers dazzling, often controversial career, spanning 7 decades across four states, as he reigned as one of Australias most popular and enduring media stars. Narrated by Tim Webster, this new Foxtel biography features exclusive interviews recorded over the years with both Bob himself, and a host of the nations best known radio and TV stars. Highlights include his place at the birth of rock and roll music and top 40 radio, and reaching a national audience of millions when he joined the Beatles as the British rock revolution swept into Australia. One constant theme of the Bob Rogers story is his fierce individualism and repeated clashes with powerful media owners. His hirings and firings frequently made news headlines, along with his legendary feud with another great radio star, John Laws.</desc></programme>

It would be the start of Bob Rogers dazzling, often controversial career, spanning 7 decades across four states, as he reigned as one of Australias most popular and enduring media stars. Narrated by Tim Webster, this new Foxtel biography features exclusive interviews recorded over the years with both Bob himself, and a host of the nations best known radio and TV stars. Highlights include his place at the birth of rock and roll music and top 40 radio, and reaching a national audience of millions when he joined the Beatles as the British rock revolution swept into Australia. One constant theme of the Bob Rogers story is his fierce individualism and repeated clashes with powerful media owners. His hirings and firings frequently made news headlines, along with his legendary feud with another great radio star, John Laws.</desc></programme>

Theyre building a stylish beach shack to retire in, one that floats on a pair of untouched sand dunes in Aldinga on Adelaides southern coast. Solar-powered, and aesthetically pleasing, it should be the perfect fit, but Robyn is yet to be convinced. Her life is entrenched in the city so she needs some cajoling. The contemporary modest design features a pair of steel clad pods joined by a timber walkway, and surrounded by native bush. But as soon as building gets under way, the excavation impacts on the environment. Despite their best efforts replanting and shoring up the dunes, the beach scrub soon dwindles and Robyn and Barry are left pondering their next course of action. As the dunes progressively erode, the more Robyn and Barry persevere. But when their self-rusting steel cladding is battered by harsh coastal conditions, staining their deck and turning the exterior into something resembling dribbled fat, Robyns doubts really set in. Can they restore their precious landscape and will Robyn eventually sever her ties with the city and make her project in the dunes home?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.6.</episode-num></programme>

But as Stephanie began to look into its history, she realised that there may have been a flour mill on the site since Domesday! So she called in Tony Robinson and his sceptical team of archaeologists to help her unravel the mystery of their accidental mill. For Professor Mick Aston the prospect was too good to turn down. As the diggers get to work uncovering the whole of the 18th-century mill, Mick takes off into the landscape to look for clues form earlier centuries. He finds more than he bargained for: the whole area was awash with the telltale mill streams needed to power grind stones. As the three days progress, the dig throws up constant reminders of the importance of wheat and bread to the medieval population and of how rich millers could become. The only spanner in the works for this perfect industrial dig is the surprise discovery of an Anglo Saxon comb.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.9.</episode-num></programme>
