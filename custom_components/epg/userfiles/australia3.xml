History conspired to enable this dynamic portrait to explode on the world scene in 1968 throughout Europe and Latin America, when it became an international symbol of protest and dissent. In the last decade, with the establishment of the Internet, the image has once again traveled the globe in many forms. From protest to commerce, it is constantly transformed and reinvented. It is considered to be the most reproduced image in the history of photography. Why and how did this photograph become so important? This is a film about a photograph. It explores how the Che image traveled from Kordas studio in Havana to the streets of Europe and beyond.

Whether its suppliers, logistics, accountants, consultants, lawyers or something else, there will be times that you need help from others. The power of building strong business partnerships, beyond functionality, is so often overlooked. Leaving behind the opportunity for multiplying impact by working together for mutual benefit. Peter chats with Chris Chong from Misfit surf brand and learns how, by asking a potential global partner, how Misfit would be a good partner, a very different conversation and partnership developed. Peter and the team explore how openness and transparency around partnering and seeking the success of the partner empowers the greater success of each partner.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.7.</episode-num></programme>

In The Listening Road, youll ride along on one mans remarkable 33-day journey cycling 3,000 miles across the United States on a mission to engage with people from all walks of life in real conversations about things that matter most. As a pastor, Neil Tomba noticed a disturbing trend among people in church: they were finding it increasingly difficult to talk about God to those outside of the church. Neil wanted to practice what he preached, so he set out to bike across the United States, talking - and, more importantly, listening - to strangers from all walks of life about faith, their stories, and matters of the heart. The Listening Road takes you on Neils remarkable journey across the country and straight into its soul - from Route 66 motels to state parks, a lake house, and a railway car; from conversations with Amish farmers to chats with truckers, cowboys, mechanics, and a descendant of Daniel Boone. From one city, farm, and highway to the next, Neil models with compassion and curiosity that genuine connection happens only if we are willing to listen in love.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.7.</episode-num></programme>

Craig Martin and Earl Bridges explore Puerto Ricos Old City (Viejo San Juan) and the vibrancy of the artists who live there. Sculptor Ana Rosa Rivera talks about using art to enhance the lives of its poorest residents. Together with her husband Charles Juhasz-Alvarado, they all tour Contrafuertes, a museum in the heart of Viejo San Juan that is a collaborative artists-driven place. Artist Freddy Mercado exhibits large costumes that represent gender identity, ageing and independence. Freddy and LGBTQ rights activist/filmmaker Carla Cavina collaborated on a film telling the story of spirituality, physical suffering and identity called "Fractura." Carla explains why art and expression through film helps people struggling with their own personal identity. Earl and Craig also tour Charles and Ana Rosas art studio and learn about struggle within the longest running colony in history. The issues are messy and not clean cut, but art often presents what is broken in society in a way that doesnt necessarily provide a solution to the brokenness. For many on the island, political independence will still require positive interaction and collaboration with the United States. Most Puerto Ricans have tight bonds with family members living in the US and breaking those bonds isnt part of the equation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.6.</episode-num></programme>

Well, if youre ex-advertising guru-turned-Japanese bar and restaurant owner Steve Minon, you track down iconic Kobe-based architect Yo Shimada to realise your dream of a Japanese-inspired Queenslander. Steve has an extremely steep block of land in the Brisbane suburb of Hamilton that will take an engineering feat of epic proportions to bring Yo Shimadas groundbreaking east-meets-west vision to life. Especially because conditions in flood-prone Queensland are vastly different from Kobe, something that becomes all too clear when the build is battered in cyclonic weather that washes much of the steep block away. With such precise and intricate design details, including the galvanised steel framework constructed by robotics, this stripped-back home takes its cues from the refinement of Japanese culture: simple, raw materials and exposed junctions that reveal the intricacies of the construction. It ticks all of Steves boxes: one bedroom, simple, elegant and pared back.
