He was joined by The Merry Band of Pranksters, a renegade group of counterculture truth-seekers, including Neal Cassady, the American icon immortalised in Kerouacs On the Road. Kesey and the Pranksters intended to make a documentary about their trip, shooting hours of 16mm footage, but the film was never finished and the footage has remained virtually unseen ... until now. Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney and Alison Ellwood were given unprecedented access to this raw footage by the Kesey family. Working with the Film Foundation, and the UCLA Film Archives, they restored over 100 hours of film and audiotape to create the extraordinary, joyous, LSD-laced Magic Trip.</desc></programme>

The over 100-year-old concept of Canadian National Parks is instrumental in protecting the unique natural environment and habitats of native flora and fauna from human influence. This is a challenging task for the employees of Parks Canada, as they have to reconcile tourism and economic interests with nature. And then, of course, there is climate change. Whether and how these developments are putting a strain on sensitive ecosystems will be the main topic of the discovery series, which brings Canadas unique landscape and culture to life.

The over 100-year-old concept of Canadian National Parks is instrumental in protecting the unique natural environment and habitats of native flora and fauna from human influence. This is a challenging task for the employees of Parks Canada, as they have to reconcile tourism and economic interests with nature. And then, of course, there is climate change. Whether and how these developments are putting a strain on sensitive ecosystems will be the main topic of the discovery series, which brings Canadas unique landscape and culture to life. Knowledgeable and charismatic protagonists, including scientists, First Nations people, environmental activists, artists and storytellers who have a special connection with the landscape guide the viewer through this journey.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num></programme>

For that simple reason, locals casually refer to the city as Mexico, and not much has changed to the food that fed the former seat of the Aztec Empire. Scenes captured by Diego Rivera in his murals still come alive in the citys bustling markets, and working mens taverns still offer pulque, the alco-pop of the ancients. But the most precious Aztec legacy are the chinampas - floating vegetable gardens found in the criss-crossing intersections of canals to the south of the city. They are an inspiration to the citys top chefs, including Eduardo Garcia, endearingly known as chef Lalo. Heading south from the capital, Rick travels to the city of Puebla, which conjures up images of Cortez and the Spanish conquest of Mexico. It is a city with impressive European architecture, talavera pottery and the home of mole, Mexicos most famous meat stew. Finally, Rick travels to the deserts of Oaxaca, where mezcal, one of the countrys most iconic drinks, is produced.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.4.</episode-num></programme>

Despite suffering nine gunshot wounds, one worker survived and was able to identify his assailant. But the case went unsolved until a random bar fight inspired police to dust off the case file. Within days, a teenager named Ruben Cantu was picked up at his high school and arrested for capital murder. Ruben was quickly convicted and sentenced to death. From death row, the barely literate teen wrote an impassioned letter to the city of San Antonio, explaining how hed been framed by police. Investigative reporter Lise Olsen caught wind of the story and began uncovering startling evidence of corruption that led to an official re-investigation of the case. But the toughest questions would land at the desk of San Antonios lionised District Attorney, Sam Millsap, who would weigh his spotless reputation against the life of a potentially innocent man.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.0.</episode-num></programme>

Six days later, a fruit picker discovered Sians mutilated body, still dressed in her Year Seven Sunshine Beach School uniform, in a creek bed. The hunt for the killers and their arrest was led by Bob Atkinson, now Queenslands police commissioner. As a result of thorough and dedicated police work by Queensland detectives, and in concert with New South Wales police, Beck and Watts were located hiding in a motel at Long Jetty on the NSW Central Coast a few weeks later.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.4.</episode-num></programme>

If the mortgage company came for an inspection, they could determine an unresolvable fault in payment and then take the house from Andy and his mother, leaving them homeless.

Despite suffering nine gunshot wounds, one worker survived and was able to identify his assailant. But the case went unsolved until a random bar fight inspired police to dust off the case file. Within days, a teenager named Ruben Cantu was picked up at his high school and arrested for capital murder. Ruben was quickly convicted and sentenced to death. From death row, the barely literate teen wrote an impassioned letter to the city of San Antonio, explaining how hed been framed by police. Investigative reporter Lise Olsen caught wind of the story and began uncovering startling evidence of corruption that led to an official re-investigation of the case. But the toughest questions would land at the desk of San Antonios lionised District Attorney, Sam Millsap, who would weigh his spotless reputation against the life of a potentially innocent man.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.0.</episode-num></programme>

Six days later, a fruit picker discovered Sians mutilated body, still dressed in her Year Seven Sunshine Beach School uniform, in a creek bed. The hunt for the killers and their arrest was led by Bob Atkinson, now Queenslands police commissioner.

Then the unthinkable happened. On Friday, August 16, 2013, Chris Lane set off for his afternoon jog in southern Oklahoma, a route hed run many times before, when he was gunned down from behind by three callous and bored teenage joyriders. Suffering severe internal injuries to his heart and lungs, Chris died on the side of the road. He was 22 years old. The three teenage boys, aged just 15, 16 and 17 at the time of the attack, are now behind bars. The youngest of the three, James Edwards Jr, was sentenced to 25 years as an accessory after the fact. The driver that day, Michael Jones, will spend at least 38 years in prison before he is eligible for parole. Chancey Luna, the boy who pulled the trigger, will never be released. But the full story behind this heartless crime has never been told. International award-winning journalist Mike Amor comes face-to-face with one of the killers who has shock admissions from behind prison walls about why and how he and his mates mercilessly took Chriss life. We hear from Chriss parents and girlfriend in their first in-depth television interviews about his death and enduring legacy.

Then the unthinkable happened. On Friday, August 16, 2013, Chris Lane set off for his afternoon jog in southern Oklahoma, a route hed run many times before, when he was gunned down from behind by three callous and bored teenage joyriders. Suffering severe internal injuries to his heart and lungs, Chris died on the side of the road. He was 22 years old. The three teenage boys, aged just 15, 16 and 17 at the time of the attack, are now behind bars. The youngest of the three, James Edwards Jr, was sentenced to 25 years as an accessory after the fact. The driver that day, Michael Jones, will spend at least 38 years in prison before he is eligible for parole. Chancey Luna, the boy who pulled the trigger, will never be released. But the full story behind this heartless crime has never been told. International award-winning journalist Mike Amor comes face-to-face with one of the killers who has shock admissions from behind prison walls about why and how he and his mates mercilessly took Chriss life. We hear from Chriss parents and girlfriend in their first in-depth television interviews about his death and enduring legacy. Featuring never-before-seen video, we uncover details of that day never revealed. The police at the centre of the investigation detail how they tracked down Chriss killers.</desc></programme>

Freddy owes Ray money which he doesnt have, as usual so he sends Ray off with newly hired heavy, Nick, to collect and keep a 10k debt. Nick hasnt collected before and proves ineffective, so Ray has to step in and do it his way to get results. Ray meets Ally at the dog park and there is immediate chemistry - but he doesnt act on it, feeling that shes out of his league. Gary is in trouble with his Russian wife, Tatiana, over the discovery of a porn DVD and asks Ray to take the blame. While out with Brittany having ice-cream they bump into some young men who knock her ice-cream to the ground and disrespect Ray. Ray assaults one of the young men responsible and while escaping the scene he runs into Ally and takes the opportunity to make his feelings a little clearer. Ally gives Ray her number.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num></programme>
