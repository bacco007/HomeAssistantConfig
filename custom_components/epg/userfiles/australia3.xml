Polley is both filmmaker and detective as she investigates the secrets kept by a family of storytellers. She playfully interviews and interrogates a cast of characters of varying reliability, eliciting refreshingly candid, yet mostly contradictory, answers to the same questions. As each relates their version of the family mythology, present-day recollections shift into nostalgia-tinged glimpses of their mother, who departed too soon, leaving a trail of unanswered questions. Polley unravels the paradoxes to reveal the essence of family: always complicated, warmly messy and fiercely loving. Stories We Tell explores the elusive nature of truth and memory, but at its core is a deeply personal film about how our narratives shape and define us as individuals and families, all interconnecting to paint a profound, funny and poignant picture of the larger human story.</desc></programme>

Combining conventional medical training with cutting edge alternative therapies, Dr. Martys deeply empathetic philosophy offers a vital example of how improving overall health rather than merely treating disease is transformative for all living things. As Goldstein and his staff interact with animals, the stakes are high and it is often touch and go as we watch the owners, some who have travelled great distances, struggle with the reality of whether or not their pets will live to see another day. "The Dog Doc" poses a serious question about whether we are over medicating our pets, our children, and ourselves while offering an immersive view into a seldom-seen world to paint a complete picture of the dedication of being a veterinarian.</desc></programme>

Iconic magicians Siegfried and Roy built an unprecedented empire based on smoke, mirrors and ferocious predators treated like cuddly pets. Their sequined acts of awe-inspiring wonder reinvented Las Vegas and made them global superstars. But the myths that made them larger than life were often more fiction than fact. Their world of illusion was ultimately destroyed by a near-fatal onstage encounter with an angry tiger - a terrifying moment that sparked countless conspiracy theories and cover-ups. Interviews with friends and peers of Siegfried and Roy take us deep inside their ultra-private life, while journalists uncover the shocking truth behind the lies spun by the illusionists before and after that fateful night. Tiger experts reveal the tragic legacy left behind by the magicians obsession with giant cats, still reverberating worldwide.</desc></programme>

Iconic magicians Siegfried and Roy built an unprecedented empire based on smoke, mirrors and ferocious predators treated like cuddly pets. Their sequined acts of awe-inspiring wonder reinvented Las Vegas and made them global superstars. But the myths that made them larger than life were often more fiction than fact. Their world of illusion was ultimately destroyed by a near-fatal onstage encounter with an angry tiger - a terrifying moment that sparked countless conspiracy theories and cover-ups. Interviews with friends and peers of Siegfried and Roy take us deep inside their ultra-private life, while journalists uncover the shocking truth behind the lies spun by the illusionists before and after that fateful night. Tiger experts reveal the tragic legacy left behind by the magicians obsession with giant cats, still reverberating worldwide.</desc></programme>

They sample some great food, visit well known sites, and experience fun activities such as white water rafting and indoor skydiving. Most importantly, they meet a host of extraordinary women, young and old, and talk about identity, purpose, relationships, beauty, choices, and much more. Throughout their travels, Jeni and Sarah will have fun, but they will always bring each episode back to one central theme: teaching young ladies about Gods grace in their lives and addressing relevant issues in a redemptive way. Jeni: Seeking the Extraordinary is different than other youth-oriented reality TV for many reasons and will stand out as a positive, biblically-based alternative to many of the secular reality shows that depict todays youth in a negative light. It offers another option for reality TV fans that love the genre but are turned off by the reckless behaviour and non-existent values system of most secular reality-based programming. In a time when immorality, irreverence, and confusion have become ordinary, Jeni: Seeking the Extraordinary will always take the high road to the extraordinary.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>

She is surprised to find that white, green and black tea are all made from the same leaves. She also discovers that the bag surrounding your tea is not ordinary paper, but a highly-engineered fabric made up of hemp, wood and polypropylene. She watches as a 60km-long roll is produced, and she gets some scientific tips on making the best possible cup of tea with a tea bag. Historian Ruth Goodman investigates tea adulteration. In the 19th-century, there were eight separate factories in London which existed solely to dry and recolour used tea leaves. She discovers that it was honest John Hornim who put that right and ensured we could trust our tea. She also finds that in the military during WWII, armoured divisions had to leave the safety of their tanks to brew-up, a habit that resulted in many casualties. She climbs on board a modern-day tank to make a cup of tea with a boiling vessel, the innovation that solved this problem.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder. Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels.

Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels. In a world exclusive, the program also includes footage as the police entered the vault for the first time.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder.

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder. Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels. In a world exclusive, the program also includes footage as the police entered the vault for the first time.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

He would become famous for his TV programs, music, and art, even painting a portrait of the Queen for her jubilee in 2012. However in August 2013, his legacy and reputation lay in tatters when he was accused of numerous indecent assaults, on girls as young as eight years old, between 1968 and 1986.

Unlike Jimmy Savile, he was still alive to be brought to justice. Originally from Australia, Rolf Harris became a television star in the UK in the 1960s. He would become famous for his TV programs, music, and art, even painting a portrait of the Queen for her jubilee in 2012. However in August 2013, his legacy and reputation lay in tatters when he was accused of numerous indecent assaults, on girls as young as eight years old, between 1968 and 1986. In July 2014, he was sentenced to five years in prison for his actions. We reveal Harriss life and his crimes, told by people who worked with him and those who represent his victims who fought so long for justice.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.0.</episode-num></programme>

The election successes of the neo-Nazi parties in Europe reveal that voters are hungry again for populist politicians who express their anger towards failing governments; but do people really want an authoritarian, nationalist government in power? The Rise of the Nazi Party reveals how the National Socialists exploited the economic turmoil of their time, rose to power in Germany in 1933 and then led their nation into a nightmare of brutality, genocide and military defeat.

Other cases are even more baffling, such as the strange incidents that have taken place in the Bermuda Triangle. While sceptics point out that they may be simple cases of bad luck, or bad weather, some researchers suggest that unknown forces may be involved.

Our modern railways were born in the industrial heartlands of the North-East, where for over 150 years, coal was king. Rob starts his journey on Wearside, where numerous short horse-drawn waggonways once pulled coal down to the river to be sailed downstream and out into the North Sea. But for Britains industrialisation to hit overdrive, an altogether slicker system was needed. In modern Sunderland, Rob finds the solution - the worlds first railway designed for steam locomotives. With the 1822 Hetton Railway, designed by George Stephenson, it was full steam ahead - not only for coal, but for railways too.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.1.</episode-num></programme>
