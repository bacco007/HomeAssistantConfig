They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large.

Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more.

In each program, Tony follows a bespoke route that allows him to explore on foot both the history of a particularly colourful period or event and the spectacular landscape in which those events unfolded. With experts he encounters on the way, Tony reveals and discovers places that ordinary walkers and ramblers might otherwise miss.

The team are intrigued by metal detecting finds and pottery scattered across the fields, which suggest theyre on the site of a high-status Anglo Saxon burial ground. By the end of the first day theres no sign of a cemetery, in spite of the evidence. But all that changes the next morning with a flurry of activity revealing burials, cremations and a glimpse of gold. Days of frantic digging reveal every type of Anglo-Saxon burial - and perhaps the finest piece of jewellery ever discovered on the program. And the team explores the unique way the Anglo-Saxons celebrated their dead when one brave digger stands in for a dead Anglo-Saxon on a funeral pyre in a fiery re-creation of a cremation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.1.</episode-num></programme>

The mosaics hint at a grand villa, but as this part of Somerset has been in constant use by the army for the last century and a half, no-one has ever had a chance to really see whats under the ground. To everyones surprise, the initial results suggest theres been more than one villa on this site. Over the following days a story emerges of the highs and lows of Roman life in Britain, from the grand rooms used for entertaining to the pitiful lives of the slaves who lived on the edge of this high society. The archaeology is impressive, but the weathers not, and as the temperatures plummet, the team hold a crisis meeting. Could this be the first time in the programs history that the conditions force the diggers to down tools?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.2.</episode-num></programme>

The mosaics hint at a grand villa, but as this part of Somerset has been in constant use by the army for the last century and a half, no-one has ever had a chance to really see whats under the ground. To everyones surprise, the initial results suggest theres been more than one villa on this site. Over the following days a story emerges of the highs and lows of Roman life in Britain, from the grand rooms used for entertaining to the pitiful lives of the slaves who lived on the edge of this high society. The archaeology is impressive, but the weathers not, and as the temperatures plummet, the team hold a crisis meeting.
