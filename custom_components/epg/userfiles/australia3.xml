They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.30.</episode-num></programme>

Cod arrives at the factory as compressed blocks of frozen fish. The blocks weigh exactly 7.484kg, which is a standardised measure in every fish factory right across the world. Gregg watches as each block is cut into 168 naked fish fingers which are then floured, battered and breaded, ready for a quick 45-second trip through the fryer. He also helps take delivery of 25 tonnes of liquid nitrogen, used to flash freeze the fingers at -15 degrees, but Gregg is amazed to discover that the fish inside the finger remains frozen through every stage of production, right up to the moment you cook it at home. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey travels to Grindavik, Iceland, where they land up to 50 tonnes of cod a day. She follows the fish through the processing factory, even trying her hand at gutting the fish. Historian Ruth Goodman is investigating the origins of cod fish fingers. She finds that Birds Eye were the first to introduce them to the UK, basing them on a US product called fish sticks.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.3.</episode-num></programme>

Its annual output is 250,000 tonnes of condiments, and more than 50 percent of this heads to the UK. Our passion for sauces sees us consume 40 million kilos of mayonnaise every year. Gregg follows its production from a farm near Arnhem, where 23,000 free range hens produce the eggs, to the factory where hes wowed by an egg-cracking machine that can separate the yolks and whites from 1700 eggs a minute. In the mayonnaise factory kitchen he discovers how the delicate process of combining oil and water, known as emulsification, is performed perfectly every time on huge 480 kilo batches. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is making the glass jars Gregg needs for his mayonnaise. Shes at a vast factory in Maastricht where a furnace holding 250 tonnes of molten glass has been running continuously for the last 11 years. Historian Ruth Goodman discovers how Brits fell in love with mayonnaise. She traces it back to the introduction of the bottled sauce in the 1960s, and samples a series of unusual mayonnaise dishes.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.4.</episode-num></programme>

Its annual output is 250,000 tonnes of condiments, and more than 50 percent of this heads to the UK. Our passion for sauces sees us consume 40 million kilos of mayonnaise every year. Gregg follows its production from a farm near Arnhem, where 23,000 free range hens produce the eggs, to the factory where hes wowed by an egg-cracking machine that can separate the yolks and whites from 1700 eggs a minute. In the mayonnaise factory kitchen he discovers how the delicate process of combining oil and water, known as emulsification, is performed perfectly every time on huge 480 kilo batches. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is making the glass jars Gregg needs for his mayonnaise. Shes at a vast factory in Maastricht where a furnace holding 250 tonnes of molten glass has been running continuously for the last 11 years. Historian Ruth Goodman discovers how Brits fell in love with mayonnaise. She traces it back to the introduction of the bottled sauce in the 1960s, and samples a series of unusual mayonnaise dishes.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.4.</episode-num></programme>

It turns 90 percent of Britains blackcurrants into soft drinks, producing three billion bottles a week. Gregg takes delivery of 500 tonnes of blackcurrants at a cider mill in Somerset. The harvest comes in during July and August when there are no apples to process for cider, so they press blackcurrants instead. Gregg is surprised by the technology they use to press the juice and amazed to discover how the aroma of the blackcurrants is captured separately and later added back into the drink to ensure it has a fully rounded flavour. Next the concentrate and aromas are transported to the drinks factory, where they are mixed with 11 other ingredients before being bottled. Gregg watches a machine that can create a plastic bottle in just 0.1 of a second, and learns why nitrogen is the secret to creating a firm bottle that wont get stuck in vending machines. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is harvesting the berries on a 220ha farm in Kent, one of 40 that supply the factory. Historian Ruth Goodman is investigating the origins of fizzy drinks. Carbonated water was first sold by a certain Mr Schweppe way back in 1783, but it was a British husband and wife team called Robert and Mary White who were to popularise fizzy pop.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.5.</episode-num></programme>

As Roy and Jillian look for an answer to the extraordinary mystery that has engulfed them, an international team of scientists led by Claude Lacombe, a dedicated French expert on extraordinary phenomena, also pursues the truth. As Lacombe and company seek to understand the phenomenon of the skies and look for a communications break-through, their cosmic detective work reaches from the Indiana plains across the world to a remote hillside in India and then to the one place that holds the answer in an ultimate close encounter.</desc></programme>

The following day, both their bodies were found dumped on waste ground, they had been battered and raped before being strangled with their own underwear. The girls were seen leaving the pub with a man but the identity of the killer would remain a mystery for the next 30 years. In 2007, Angus Sinclair was charged with the girls murder after new DNA evidence linked Sinclair and his brother in law Gordon to the murders. However the trial sensationally collapsed when a piece of crucial evidence was withdrawn. Unbeknownst to the jury, Hamilton had a history of sex attacks starting at the age of 16 and culminating him serving a life sentence for the murder of a 17 year old woman in Glasgow in 1978. In 2014, following the development of new DNA technology, Prosecutors successfully applied for a change in a centurys old law allowing the same man to be tried twice for the same crime. This time, the trial proved successful and Sinclair was jailed for a minimum of 37 years. He has been described as Scotlands worst serial killer and the authorities believe he may well have been responsible for numerous other murders.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.3.</episode-num></programme>

As Hitler advanced across Europe, gold from defeated countries was shipped to Germany to fund the war machine. Hitler found other sources of income - and Jewish prisoners lost everything: jewellery, savings, even their gold fillings. And Jews who stored money in neutral Swiss banks would never see that money again. We trace some of the millions of dollars of gold and dirty money that went missing following the wars end.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.14.</episode-num></programme>

Its the twenty-first century but it could be the 1930s. The election successes of the neo-Nazi parties in Europe reveal that voters are hungry again for populist politicians who express their anger towards failing governments; but do people really want an authoritarian, nationalist government in power? The Rise of the Nazi Party reveals how the National Socialists exploited the economic turmoil of their time, rose to power in Germany in 1933 and then led their nation into a nightmare of brutality, genocide and military defeat. This documentary series tells the true story of the rise of the Nazis through archive film footage, interviews and dramatic reconstructions and carries on the chilling story after the war to chart the current rise of the neo-Nazis.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>
