Ryan and Colin use audience suggested lines to act out a Cinderella Whose Line scenario before acting out scenes from a hat including strange psychiatrists and TV shows that shouldnt be sexy.

We fall into a trap of determining our value, worth or significance based on what weve achieved or what we have. However, as we dig a little deeper and reflect on history, we see that its not always the person who shouts the loudest, with the highest credentials or even the most wealth that makes the greatest impact. In this short 30-minute program, with the help of Australian and international speakers we will explore what it means to live a life of significance. Our guests have diverse backgrounds, and include politicians, journalists, authors and pastors. Join us as each of them share stories about their own unique personal discovery of significance. Well learn more on shared misconceptions and roadblocks and ultimately how men and women of Christian faith today live lives of significance.</desc></programme>

This was looking unlikely until they found an inexpensive block on a ridge above a freeway at Ocean Shores (near Byron). Now all they need is an architecture firm inventive enough to design them a stylish home for very little money. Their modest, forward-thinking philosophy is helpful as they naturally veer away from lavish floor plans and luxurious finishes in favour of the compact, simple, open, sustainable and economical. Working within a tenuous loan framework what they get, apart from stress, is quite fantastic.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.4.</episode-num></programme>

So when electrician and stay-at-home dad Tom and his doctor wife Zewlan decided to build their new home in Ocean Shores, size was everything. Their plan is for a solar passive family home with three modest bedrooms that maximise potential views; small, beautiful spaces on a firm budget of $350,000. With the help of award-winning architects Melanie and James, theyve come up with a design based on the three Ss: small, simple and straightforward. Built out of chipboard, the house will be just half the size of the average Australian home. In a simple layout, three modest bedrooms will connect to one long outside/inside corridor running the length of the house and open underneath, like a deck. The lounge, kitchen and mezzanine will all be easily closed off with huge sliding glass. Toms biggest concern is for the finishes after the exposed chipboard is damaged by some wet weather, hes keen to get the roof on. Will financial pressure and some inclement weather force a re-think or will he and Zewlan stay true to their small house philosophy?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.5.</episode-num></programme>

But 200 years ago Derwentcote was at the heart of an iron- and steel-producing complex that fuelled the spread of empire. Over three days the team fights through the undergrowth to reveal the furnaces and forges that produced the raw materials of industry under appalling conditions. As well as their chainsaws and mechanical diggers, the archaeologists draw on an unusual resource: the memoirs of an 18th-century industrial spy who visited the site. And with the help of old records, they can even put names and trades to the people who occupied the workers cottages that once stood alongside the works. Its a story of how cottage industry gave way to the might of the industrial cities such as Sheffield, and the team uncovers the highs and lows of the working life of Derwentcote. On top of all that, Tony discovers how excited grown men can be when they get to analyse huge lumps of 200-year-old slag.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.4.</episode-num></programme>

The team is here to help the new owners, who have saved the house from dereliction, to find out what has gone on in their garden over the centuries. Its full of tantalising glimpses of archaeology: a medieval wall with a window, carved stones, and what looks like the remains of a Norman castle. Sorting this lot out is the kind of challenge the team cant resist. Over three days they discover this remarkable piece of land contains over 600 years of archaeology. It may seem run-down now, but it once belonged to one of the most powerful families in medieval Britain, the Greys. Monumental walls and grand manors emerge from the trenches as Tony is joined by historian and international bestselling author Philippa Gregory to piece together the intriguing tale of this power-hungry family. He discovers a dynasty that arrived with William the Conqueror and went on to produce two queens of England: Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.6.</episode-num></programme>

But 200 years ago Derwentcote was at the heart of an iron- and steel-producing complex that fuelled the spread of empire. Over three days the team fights through the undergrowth to reveal the furnaces and forges that produced the raw materials of industry under appalling conditions. As well as their chainsaws and mechanical diggers, the archaeologists draw on an unusual resource: the memoirs of an 18th-century industrial spy who visited the site. And with the help of old records, they can even put names and trades to the people who occupied the workers cottages that once stood alongside the works. Its a story of how cottage industry gave way to the might of the industrial cities such as Sheffield, and the team uncovers the highs and lows of the working life of Derwentcote. On top of all that, Tony discovers how excited grown men can be when they get to analyse huge lumps of 200-year-old slag.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.4.</episode-num></programme>

The team is here to help the new owners, who have saved the house from dereliction, to find out what has gone on in their garden over the centuries. Its full of tantalising glimpses of archaeology: a medieval wall with a window, carved stones, and what looks like the remains of a Norman castle. Sorting this lot out is the kind of challenge the team cant resist. Over three days they discover this remarkable piece of land contains over 600 years of archaeology. It may seem run-down now, but it once belonged to one of the most powerful families in medieval Britain, the Greys. Monumental walls and grand manors emerge from the trenches as Tony is joined by historian and international bestselling author Philippa Gregory to piece together the intriguing tale of this power-hungry family. He discovers a dynasty that arrived with William the Conqueror and went on to produce two queens of England: Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.6.</episode-num></programme>
