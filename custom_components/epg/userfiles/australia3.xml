Warner: The Last Mogul</title><desc>The epic documentary portrait of the pioneering film producer whose studio, Warner Bros., gave us such Hollywood classics as Little Caesar, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon, Yankee Doodle Dandy, Rebel Without A Cause, My Fair Lady, Bonnie and Clyde and hundreds more. Hailed by reviewers as "one of the best films about a movie studio", Jack L. Warner: The Last Mogul reveals the behind-the-scenes story of the man whom Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, and Bugs Bunny called "boss". Produced by Jack Warners grandson, Emmy Award-nominated filmmaker Gregory Orr, the film provides an insiders access to memories and material never before seen by the public. Included are rare photographs, home movies, Warner Bros. film clips and exclusive interviews that capture the life and times of a Hollywood legend.</desc></programme>

However, if this continues as the business grows, that leader will find themselves feeling tired, lonely and without hope. Peter talks with Kent Medwin about the idea of servant leadership - where a leader is proactively working to empower the success of the team as it grows. Kent shares how without this approach, where instead the leader holds onto making all decisions, they become a significant barrier to success. Peter and the team unpack the value that decentralised decision making creates a culture of empowerment and whilst it can be slow to get started, slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.9.</episode-num></programme>

In 2000 he was convicted of murdering 215 patients by lethal injection. For over 20 years this general practitioner worked under the guise of a kind, caring man of the community. Whilst fooling his family, colleagues and patients he preyed on those who trusted them the most and killed them with an injection of diamorphine. Such a trusted pillar of the community, Shipman, went unquestioned for years killing men and women in the small town of Hyde, in the UK. His cover was eventually blown when he tried to forge one victims will. The true devastation unravelled revealing the doctor to be one of the worlds biggest single serial killers of all time. Shipman never revealed his motive and committed suicide in prison in 2004. This film documents Shipmans horrendous crimes told by the people who were affected by his crimes.

After months of hard fighting the Allies were advancing towards the Rhine and to the east the Russians were closing in on Berlin as part of Operation Bagration. But now Nazi occupied Eastern Europe was giving up its secrets to horrified Allied troops.

Survivors remember in this episode. By the end of April the Red Army was in Berlin and Hitler was deep in his bunker. He and his new wife Eva Braun committed suicide on April 30th. Just one week later - May 7 - the formal unconditional German surrender came. The following day was declared VE Day in Britain and the "German War" was over.
