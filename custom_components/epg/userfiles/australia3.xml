They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more.

The design incorporates a huge, taut translucent sail - normally used in commercial projects - covering a simple rectangular pavilion underneath. Its a brave concept but the true magic of the design lies in the retractable roof, which peels back to showcase the rainforest canopies overhead. Nick and Nicole will be able to lie in bed and literally look at the stars. But will this super-engineered tent simply look like a conference centre in the middle of the lush, green rainforest?

So when the couple decided to build their first-ever family home in the Adelaide suburb of Hillbank, it was no surprise that the city of churches would provide plenty of inspiration. Not that they want a church-like house. Neil is chasing a barn-inspired house with big, heavy timber beams. So theyve chosen to create a medieval manor built in the traditional way using methods from another time. The bones of the houses eight huge A-frames will be built by hand out of timber by a team of specialist carpenters. Thousands of timber shingles will cover the massive roof, with a two-storey high Gothic glass window the centrepiece of the house. But Neil is constantly let down by suppliers and has grossly underestimated the cost of the build, so work on the site stalls. When summer hits and temperatures soar well into the 40s, the exposed A-frame timber beams begin to warp and crack. They elect to use something straight off a warehouse floor - insulated refrigerator panels on the roof and walls - a most unlikely fit for a medieval house. Not only do they look incongruous, they are hell to work with and expensive. What ensues is a tug of war between old and new materials; between a passion for the past and unsavoury reality. With a blind faith that sees Neil try to ignore spiralling costs, he enlists the help of his family to finish his passion project, turning a build he hoped would last a few months into a five-year revelation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.3.</episode-num></programme>

So when the couple decided to build their first-ever family home in the Adelaide suburb of Hillbank, it was no surprise that the city of churches would provide plenty of inspiration. Not that they want a church-like house. Neil is chasing a barn-inspired house with big, heavy timber beams. So theyve chosen to create a medieval manor built in the traditional way using methods from another time. The bones of the houses eight huge A-frames will be built by hand out of timber by a team of specialist carpenters. Thousands of timber shingles will cover the massive roof, with a two-storey high Gothic glass window the centrepiece of the house. But Neil is constantly let down by suppliers and has grossly underestimated the cost of the build, so work on the site stalls. When summer hits and temperatures soar well into the 40s, the exposed A-frame timber beams begin to warp and crack. They elect to use something straight off a warehouse floor - insulated refrigerator panels on the roof and walls - a most unlikely fit for a medieval house. Not only do they look incongruous, they are hell to work with and expensive. What ensues is a tug of war between old and new materials; between a passion for the past and unsavoury reality. With a blind faith that sees Neil try to ignore spiralling costs, he enlists the help of his family to finish his passion project, turning a build he hoped would last a few months into a five-year revelation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.3.</episode-num></programme>

The others were John Travers and Michael Murdoch. Michael Murphy, 33 at the time of the murder, was the eldest of the nine Murphy children.

At the same time, Britain struggled to maintain its toehold on Malta to ensure that the French fleet did not fall into the hands of the Axis powers. This episode also explores the story of the war in Greece, which was invaded by the Italians in 1940, the Germans in 1941 and finally by the British in 1944. It looks at the constant fight against the German Luftwaffe, which arrived in the Mediterranean in 1941 and did terrible damage to Allied shipping, resulting on the loss of bases in North Africa. The programme also delves into the fascinating story of Operation Mercury, German invasion of Crete, the bloody battle which cost more than 10,000 lives and of the fight for the island of Sicily in 1943, which saw the miraculous evacuation of some 100,000 Axis troops.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.5.</episode-num></programme>

During four years of bitter and bloody fighting between the states, more than 600,000 troops from the Union and Confederate sides lost their lives.

Aerial photographs and dogged local investigation suggest Dinmore Hill was once the site of a vast Iron Age hill fort and the diggers job is to find the evidence to confirm this important discovery. With the site covering some 40 acres, the team expected no shortage of targets to dig, but a frustrated geophys team initially failed to find a single satisfactory target. Undaunted, a 40-metre long trench went in to try to find the immense defensive ditch that was believed to surround the site. But as the end of day one approached, it looked like the diggers were finally beginning to get a grip on this frustrating site. And then the rain started. As trenches were shut for fear of imminent collapse, the archaeologists strive to understand the monument. There are clashes over the purpose and date of the prehistoric archaeology theyre discovering. As the soaked and tired team conclude a gruelling three-day dig, they discover a site that dominated the landscape for over a thousand years and was the ultimate statement of power and status.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">16.11.</episode-num></programme>

Filmed extensively in Russia, this film reveals the life of a man who came to amass colossal power and exert malign influence over his country for more than 20 years. Stalin emerged as the true victor of the Second World War, having gained a vast Empire in the East. But victory over the Germans was not enough, and his attitude towards the West was fuelled by his growing paranoia. Access to a wealth of new material allows us to glimpse behind Stalins granite mask into his extraordinary private world.</desc></programme>

The tensions rise as a hardy bunch of diggers battle the trees and undergrowth covering the mystery building, while the rest of the team turn their attention to the pristine lawns of Litlington. After three days, the team and the villagers discover the truth about Roman Litlington and not only find the missing villa, but also the remains of an ornate Roman cemetery.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">16.10.</episode-num></programme>

The great battle between the Italian Navy and Britains vastly outnumbered Royal Navy dominated the seas during the early years of the war as both sides sought to support the land campaigns in Egypt and East Africa. At the same time, Britain struggled to maintain its toehold on Malta to ensure that the French fleet did not fall into the hands of the Axis powers. This episode also explores the story of the war in Greece, which was invaded by the Italians in 1940, the Germans in 1941 and finally by the British in 1944. It looks at the constant fight against the German Luftwaffe, which arrived in the Mediterranean in 1941 and did terrible damage to Allied shipping, resulting on the loss of bases in North Africa. The programme also delves into the fascinating story of Operation Mercury, German invasion of Crete, the bloody battle which cost more than 10,000 lives and of the fight for the island of Sicily in 1943, which saw the miraculous evacuation of some 100,000 Axis troops.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.5.</episode-num></programme>

Stalin emerged as the true victor of the Second World War, having gained a vast Empire in the East. But victory over the Germans was not enough, and his attitude towards the West was fuelled by his growing paranoia.

The King himself had shown considerable personal courage during the battle; however, his cause was not helped by Prince Ruperts infamous attack on the baggage train, which meant that the day was lost before he could return to the field.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.24.</episode-num></programme>

Artis claims to have found Roman statues, buildings and even burials declaring the site a Temple to Diana. He publishes a series of drawings and a map, but no report was ever published and over time the site was lost. Fast forward to 2005, where a wildlife ranger stumbles across well-preserved walls, painted plaster and high-status pottery. The question is what is it: a mansion, a villa, an industrial centre? The team has three days to finish the job Artis started and find some answers.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">16.12.</episode-num></programme>

Dr Dawns in the mobile clinic on the beach, and her first patient is Russell, with a huge protrusion that hes kept under wraps for 10 years. Meanwhile, Dr Christian and Dr Pixie hit the night-time bars and clubs to find frisky young Brits. Theyre armed with a new rapid test for chlamydia, the number one sexually transmitted infection. Back in the UK, Dr Pixie sees a young woman with two wombs who wants advice on carrying a baby, and a 20-year-old with inflamed tonsils that she has to clean out with a cotton bud. Dr Dawn helps a woman whos been sitting on her embarrassing rectal prolapse for a decade, and Dr Christian tackles a worrying case of warts. The doctors also meet a woman living with an extraordinary condition that means her left leg is permanently clenched up by her hip. Finally, Dr Dawn addresses the stigma of bowel cancer - by testing her own poo for signs of the disease.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.0.</episode-num></programme>

Dr Dawns in the mobile clinic on the beach, and her first patient is Russell, with a huge protrusion that hes kept under wraps for 10 years. Meanwhile, Dr Christian and Dr Pixie hit the night-time bars and clubs to find frisky young Brits. Theyre armed with a new rapid test for chlamydia, the number one sexually transmitted infection. Back in the UK, Dr Pixie sees a young woman with two wombs who wants advice on carrying a baby, and a 20-year-old with inflamed tonsils that she has to clean out with a cotton bud. Dr Dawn helps a woman whos been sitting on her embarrassing rectal prolapse for a decade, and Dr Christian tackles a worrying case of warts. The doctors also meet a woman living with an extraordinary condition that means her left leg is permanently clenched up by her hip. Finally, Dr Dawn addresses the stigma of bowel cancer - by testing her own poo for signs of the disease.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.0.</episode-num></programme>
