They sample some great food, visit well known sites, and experience fun activities such as white water rafting and indoor skydiving. Most importantly, they meet a host of extraordinary women, young and old, and talk about identity, purpose, relationships, beauty, choices, and much more. Throughout their travels, Jeni and Sarah will have fun, but they will always bring each episode back to one central theme: teaching young ladies about Gods grace in their lives and addressing relevant issues in a redemptive way. Jeni: Seeking the Extraordinary is different than other youth-oriented reality TV for many reasons and will stand out as a positive, biblically-based alternative to many of the secular reality shows that depict todays youth in a negative light. It offers another option for reality TV fans that love the genre but are turned off by the reckless behaviour and non-existent values system of most secular reality-based programming. In a time when immorality, irreverence, and confusion have become ordinary, Jeni: Seeking the Extraordinary will always take the high road to the extraordinary.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>

But after the flames were put out, investigators discovered the pair had been stabbed to death before arson consumed their home. The town drunk and a local nursing aide soon fingered two men as the killers, among them, Randy Steidl. Even Steidls brother, an Illinois cop, thought he was guilty, and Randy received the death penalty. But when Michael Callahan, a promising young cop with the Illinois State Police, started looking at the case, he encountered lies, corruption and evidence of guilt pointing to just about everyone in Illinois except Randy Steidl.

The men used their Vauxhall Tigra to strike the soldier from behind as he crossed the road. They then proceeded to use knives to hack at Lees body in an attempt to decapitate him before dumping him in the middle of the road. These sickening events were caught on camera phones by horrified onlookers and the killers were filmed claiming to have carried out the attack in the name of Allah. In a dramatic sequence of events, police arrived at the scene within minutes and shot at the two men as they ran towards them holding up their weapons. Both Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey. In this programme we speak to witnesses to the attack and experts on terrorism to examine how two young British men could be radicalised to such an extent that they killed an innocent man in the name of religion.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.1.</episode-num></programme>

Once a harbinger of death for merchant shipping and its escorts, by 1943, the British and American fleets had gained the upper hand and the U-boat had become the hunted rather than the hunter. This film features extensive footage from the Battle of the Atlantic, and of U-534 the last surviving U-boat in Western Europe. She was sunk in the Baltic in 1945 and raised again to the surface intact in 1993. On board U-534 the treasures of World War II were preserved as if in aspic.
