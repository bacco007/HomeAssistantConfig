Polley is both filmmaker and detective as she investigates the secrets kept by a family of storytellers. She playfully interviews and interrogates a cast of characters of varying reliability, eliciting refreshingly candid, yet mostly contradictory, answers to the same questions. As each relates their version of the family mythology, present-day recollections shift into nostalgia-tinged glimpses of their mother, who departed too soon, leaving a trail of unanswered questions. Polley unravels the paradoxes to reveal the essence of family: always complicated, warmly messy and fiercely loving. Stories We Tell explores the elusive nature of truth and memory, but at its core is a deeply personal film about how our narratives shape and define us as individuals and families, all interconnecting to paint a profound, funny and poignant picture of the larger human story.</desc></programme>

Polley is both filmmaker and detective as she investigates the secrets kept by a family of storytellers. She playfully interviews and interrogates a cast of characters of varying reliability, eliciting refreshingly candid, yet mostly contradictory, answers to the same questions. As each relates their version of the family mythology, present-day recollections shift into nostalgia-tinged glimpses of their mother, who departed too soon, leaving a trail of unanswered questions. Polley unravels the paradoxes to reveal the essence of family: always complicated, warmly messy and fiercely loving. Stories We Tell explores the elusive nature of truth and memory, but at its core is a deeply personal film about how our narratives shape and define us as individuals and families, all interconnecting to paint a profound, funny and poignant picture of the larger human story.</desc></programme>

Iconic magicians Siegfried and Roy built an unprecedented empire based on smoke, mirrors and ferocious predators treated like cuddly pets. Their sequined acts of awe-inspiring wonder reinvented Las Vegas and made them global superstars. But the myths that made them larger than life were often more fiction than fact. Their world of illusion was ultimately destroyed by a near-fatal onstage encounter with an angry tiger - a terrifying moment that sparked countless conspiracy theories and cover-ups. Interviews with friends and peers of Siegfried and Roy take us deep inside their ultra-private life, while journalists uncover the shocking truth behind the lies spun by the illusionists before and after that fateful night. Tiger experts reveal the tragic legacy left behind by the magicians obsession with giant cats, still reverberating worldwide.</desc></programme>

Iconic magicians Siegfried and Roy built an unprecedented empire based on smoke, mirrors and ferocious predators treated like cuddly pets. Their sequined acts of awe-inspiring wonder reinvented Las Vegas and made them global superstars. But the myths that made them larger than life were often more fiction than fact. Their world of illusion was ultimately destroyed by a near-fatal onstage encounter with an angry tiger - a terrifying moment that sparked countless conspiracy theories and cover-ups. Interviews with friends and peers of Siegfried and Roy take us deep inside their ultra-private life, while journalists uncover the shocking truth behind the lies spun by the illusionists before and after that fateful night. Tiger experts reveal the tragic legacy left behind by the magicians obsession with giant cats, still reverberating worldwide.</desc></programme>

Gregg turns his 20-tonne batch into 6.9 million bags. Along the way, he discovers that there can be up to 20 different teas in your bag and that the recipe for the blend is altered every day, measured against a standard created in 1978. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey discovers the secrets of the tea leaf in an African tea-processing plant. She learns that 40 percent of each leaf is made up of chemicals called polyphenols. She is surprised to find that white, green and black tea are all made from the same leaves. She also discovers that the bag surrounding your tea is not ordinary paper, but a highly-engineered fabric made up of hemp, wood and polypropylene. She watches as a 60km-long roll is produced, and she gets some scientific tips on making the best possible cup of tea with a tea bag. Historian Ruth Goodman investigates tea adulteration. In the 19th-century, there were eight separate factories in London which existed solely to dry and recolour used tea leaves. She discovers that it was honest John Hornim who put that right and ensured we could trust our tea. She also finds that in the military during WWII, armoured divisions had to leave the safety of their tanks to brew-up, a habit that resulted in many casualties. She climbs on board a modern-day tank to make a cup of tea with a boiling vessel, the innovation that solved this problem.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder. Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels. In a world exclusive, the program also includes footage as the police entered the vault for the first time.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder. Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels. In a world exclusive, the program also includes footage as the police entered the vault for the first time.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

The V1, otherwise known as the Doodle Bug, would cause havoc in the streets of Britains capital. However, as the Allied forces closed in on the Third Reich in a desperate attempt to stop the onslaught, the V2 was launched for the first time. In the dying days of the Third Reich, who would have believed that such a weapon could have been produced? A weapon, if given more time, that could have completely altered the outcome of the war.

Once the devastating body count was finally admitted, it would be referred to as the greatest mass murderer of the day. Now this two part limited series reveals how the four day Smog fell suddenly across London wreaking havoc and fear as the city was paralysed by its thick suffocating layer of industrial toxicity. Now, medic Xand Van Tulleken and historian Raksha Dave, delve into forgotten archives and hear first hand from octogenarians and nonagenarians who lived through the Smog, to uncover the true story of what happened hour by deadly hour, and the catastrophic legacy left, even as the Smog lifted and London could breathe again.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze.

As the industrial might and great cities of Germany suffered as never before, Hitler promised revenge. Soon, vengeance weapons were developed and deployed, a turning point in the technological history of warfare. The V1, otherwise known as the Doodle Bug, would cause havoc in the streets of Britains capital. However, as the Allied forces closed in on the Third Reich in a desperate attempt to stop the onslaught, the V2 was launched for the first time. In the dying days of the Third Reich, who would have believed that such a weapon could have been produced? A weapon, if given more time, that could have completely altered the outcome of the war. Featuring rare archive footage, stunning 3D computer graphics and rare film of the last surviving rockets, this is a privileged glimpse into the world of Hitlers arsenal.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.1.</episode-num></programme>

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze. Often the blaze stoked such animosities that the fires of intrigue and betrayal never went out.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.11.</episode-num></programme>

As the industrial might and great cities of Germany suffered as never before, Hitler promised revenge. Soon, vengeance weapons were developed and deployed, a turning point in the technological history of warfare. The V1, otherwise known as the Doodle Bug, would cause havoc in the streets of Britains capital. However, as the Allied forces closed in on the Third Reich in a desperate attempt to stop the onslaught, the V2 was launched for the first time. In the dying days of the Third Reich, who would have believed that such a weapon could have been produced? A weapon, if given more time, that could have completely altered the outcome of the war. Featuring rare archive footage, stunning 3D computer graphics and rare film of the last surviving rockets, this is a privileged glimpse into the world of Hitlers arsenal.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.1.</episode-num></programme>
