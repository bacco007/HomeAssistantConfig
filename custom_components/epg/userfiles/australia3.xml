This documentary reveals the stories behind the magazine covers, displaying these multicultural pioneers as they are: beautiful, candid, courageous and outspoken. Each woman shares her experiences, ideas on longevity and philosophy of life in the fashion industry. About Face celebrates the raw intelligence and staying power of these timeless icons and doesnt shy away from asking tough questions which plague the fashion industry: sexual harassment, racism, plastic surgery and body image.

Uniting a cast of mega beauties such as Christie Brinkley, Christy Turlington, Cheryl Tiegs, Jerry Hall, Isabella Rossellini and Paulina Porizkova, filmmaker Timothy Greenfield-Sanders explores the hidden ugly side of the beauty industry, and the faces which made it such a fascination. This documentary reveals the stories behind the magazine covers, displaying these multicultural pioneers as they are: beautiful, candid, courageous and outspoken. Each woman shares her experiences, ideas on longevity and philosophy of life in the fashion industry. About Face celebrates the raw intelligence and staying power of these timeless icons and doesnt shy away from asking tough questions which plague the fashion industry: sexual harassment, racism, plastic surgery and body image.

Chronicling the drug influx of the 1970s and 80s and the resulting gang wars and violence, this is an eye-opening profile of the Miami underworld.

Taking centrestage are ex-drug dealers/smugglers Jon Roberts and Mickey Munday, who lay out the structure behind the production, import and sale of cocaine, as well as providing their own reminiscences on the excessive heyday of Miamis vice. When the drug business boomed - Miami banks almost ran out of space to store cash deposits - violence inevitably followed.

In The Listening Road, youll ride along on one mans remarkable 33-day journey cycling 3,000 miles across the United States on a mission to engage with people from all walks of life in real conversations about things that matter most. As a pastor, Neil Tomba noticed a disturbing trend among people in church: they were finding it increasingly difficult to talk about God to those outside of the church. Neil wanted to practice what he preached, so he set out to bike across the United States, talking - and, more importantly, listening - to strangers from all walks of life about faith, their stories, and matters of the heart. The Listening Road takes you on Neils remarkable journey across the country and straight into its soul - from Route 66 motels to state parks, a lake house, and a railway car; from conversations with Amish farmers to chats with truckers, cowboys, mechanics, and a descendant of Daniel Boone. From one city, farm, and highway to the next, Neil models with compassion and curiosity that genuine connection happens only if we are willing to listen in love.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.5.</episode-num></programme>

Maeve visits the inspiring Ricupero family who settled in Jarrahdale outside Perth, where they grow vegetables on a large scale and bake 140 loaves of bread every two weeks in the huge oven they built themselves - the crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside pane di casa so adored by Italians. Guy then shows a recipe for delicious bruschetta, using day-old bread. Guy joins olive oil producer Joe Grilli from Primo Estate in McLaren Vale at harvest time and learns about mixing oils for the perfect blend. Vongole harvester Tony Petruzzelli takes us to work as he rakes waist-deep in water off Adelaides outer harbour, then Sydney chef Eugenio Maiale cooks up the classic spaghetti alla vongole, the one dish that he always keeps on his menu at his popular inner-city restaurant A Tavola. For sweets, the crunchy fried biscuit cannoli filled with fresh ricotta is close to heaven, especially when its made by second-generation Sicilian sweets master Achille Mellini from Grossi Florentino.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num></programme>

Ask any detective - they will tell you that if they dont have a lead, a suspect or an arrest within 48 hours, their chances of solving the case are cut in half. In a visual style that feels more like a TV drama than a verite reality show, this program follows homicide detectives during these initial critical hours as they race against time to solve their cases. The program follows various detectives of a few select homicide teams as they track breaking cases - each with a running clock that builds pace as the 48 hours inexorably expires.

Ask any detective - they will tell you that if they dont have a lead, a suspect or an arrest within 48 hours, their chances of solving the case are cut in half. In a visual style that feels more like a TV drama than a verite reality show, this program follows homicide detectives during these initial critical hours as they race against time to solve their cases. The program follows various detectives of a few select homicide teams as they track breaking cases - each with a running clock that builds pace as the 48 hours inexorably expires. In this episode, an innocent mother is viciously murdered with a butcher knife. In Atlanta, a beloved patriarch is gunned down when a game of dominoes turns deadly.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">18.10.</episode-num></programme>

The massive castle that dominates the shore today is a Tudor structure built on earlier foundations, and its that early castle, built by King John, that the team is looking for. Unfortunately, everything is built on top of a rock outcrop with the steepest sides the archaeologists have ever encountered, and they have to employ mountaineers to help get them and their equipment up the sheer slopes; its not an excavation for the faint-hearted. As the dig continues, shadows of that original castle are discovered and a story emerges of how Mont Orgueil came to symbolise Jersey and the Channel Islands peculiar relationship with Britain and France. It was fought over, lost, and won back again for centuries, but the massive stone walls that the team uncover ultimately proved futile against the might of gunpowder.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.7.</episode-num></programme>

The team is here to help the new owners, who have saved the house from dereliction, to find out what has gone on in their garden over the centuries. Its full of tantalising glimpses of archaeology: a medieval wall with a window, carved stones, and what looks like the remains of a Norman castle. Sorting this lot out is the kind of challenge the team cant resist. Over three days they discover this remarkable piece of land contains over 600 years of archaeology. It may seem run-down now, but it once belonged to one of the most powerful families in medieval Britain, the Greys. Monumental walls and grand manors emerge from the trenches as Tony is joined by historian and international bestselling author Philippa Gregory to piece together the intriguing tale of this power-hungry family. He discovers a dynasty that arrived with William the Conqueror and went on to produce two queens of England: Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.6.</episode-num></programme>

The team is here to help the new owners, who have saved the house from dereliction, to find out what has gone on in their garden over the centuries. Its full of tantalising glimpses of archaeology: a medieval wall with a window, carved stones, and what looks like the remains of a Norman castle. Sorting this lot out is the kind of challenge the team cant resist. Over three days they discover this remarkable piece of land contains over 600 years of archaeology. It may seem run-down now, but it once belonged to one of the most powerful families in medieval Britain, the Greys. Monumental walls and grand manors emerge from the trenches as Tony is joined by historian and international bestselling author Philippa Gregory to piece together the intriguing tale of this power-hungry family. He discovers a dynasty that arrived with William the Conqueror and went on to produce two queens of England: Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.6.</episode-num></programme>

A big empty field with a manor house in it is what geophysics was invented for, but what should be a straightforward search quickly becomes one of the most baffling and frustrating investigations Time Team have undertaken for a long time. As the three-day limit approaches, the digging becomes more and more frantic as fields and gardens are overturned by the diggers trying to get to grips with the missing manor.
