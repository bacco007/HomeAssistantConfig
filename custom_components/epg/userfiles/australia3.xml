Directed by Garret Price (Love, Antosha), the film tells the story of Woodstock99, a music festival promoted to echo unity and counterculture idealism of the original 1969 concert, but instead devolved into riots, looting, and sexual assaults. Unfolding over three days of intense heat and non-stop performances, Woodstock 99: Peace, Love, and Rage examines how the festival eventually collapsed under the weight of its own misguided ambition and resulted in a grim outcome, earning the event the infamous distinction of the day the nineties died. The documentary focuses a spotlight on American youth at the end of the millennium, in the shadow of Columbine and the looming hysteria of Y2K, pinpointing a moment in time when the angst of a generation galvanized into a seism.</desc></programme>
