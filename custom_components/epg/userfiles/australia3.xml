From a childhood in the small town of Epworth in the North of England to a scholarly education at Oxford University, and from humble beginnings in Bristol to an influential base in London, John Wesleys impact is still felt, though not completely recognised today. John Wesley travelled England more than any other person in history. In the 1700s he established schools, medical centres and chapels as he challenged social, political and religious structures to bring about justice for the marginalised. Filmed in elegant chapels, bustling towns and historical sites in Epworth, Oxford, Bristol, Cornwall and in London, this biographical documentary follows respected teacher and commentator Keith Garner as he discovers the makings and influence of a man whose work in the 18th Century would go on to impact the Entire British Empire for over 200 years.</desc></programme>

Weeks later, Richard pronounced himself King. The boys were never seen again. For more than 500 years it has been assumed that Richard killed his nephews in a craven attempt at glory.
