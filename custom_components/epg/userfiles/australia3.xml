The before and after reveals of his work are always highlights, in part because of the history nuggets Rick Dale shares about each object, whether its a barber chair or a gas pump. In this spinoff series, featuring the dynamic characters at Ricks workplace, viewers will watch a variety of objects be bought, bartered and transformed, learning the process of restoration; how do you duplicate Coke machine red? Where can you find 1920s tires? A storyteller who works with tools instead of a pen, Rick shares when and why objects were invented, who used them and how fixing or transforming them changes their value.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.15.</episode-num></programme>

Fast food and Hugh do not traditionally go hand-in-hand. There is one exception, however, the findus crispy pancake. By resurrecting their favourite flavours Hugh and River Cottage chef Gill Mellow takes a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Hugh travels to Cornwall to join a group of fisherman who have found a sustainable and lucrative market in line caught squid fishing. After an early morning at sea, Hugh cooks the men deep fried salt and pepper squid with a sweet chilli dipping sauce before the rest of their catch travels to Londons sushi restaurants. Hughs campaign to get more rabbits back in the culinary food chain is picked up and championed by chef Tim Maddams. His first task is to persuade his local curry house not only to experiment with spicy rabbits, but to confidently stick them on their menu. The Landshare campaign, which matches landowners who have land to spare with would-be growers, continues to capture the imagination of the nation. Hugh visits a community who have benefited from the match and are determined to continue to grow and rear their own produce. Chilli and pumpkin night arrives and Hugh has squashes to pickle, chillies to roast and pumpkins to mash in the frenzied run up to this fiery evening.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>

He follows the production of pocket-sprung mattresses from the arrival of hard steel right through to soft bedding heading out of dispatch. Along the way he learns how lengths of metal are stretched into thin wire and coiled into springs which are placed into individual pockets. And how the mattresses are designed to wick sweat away from our bodies with the help of natural fibres like hemp and wool. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is learning whether there are benefits to be had from taking an afternoon nap. She meets up with a sleep scientist who tells her that we should be making time for a snooze rather than reaching for a cup of coffee. To prove his point, he runs an experiment which demonstrates that reaction times can be improved by a short sleep. 20 minutes is the optimum nap time - any longer risks falling in to a deep sleep which is difficult to wake from.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.3.</episode-num></programme>

Fast food and Hugh do not traditionally go hand-in-hand. There is one exception, however, the findus crispy pancake. By resurrecting their favourite flavours Hugh and River Cottage chef Gill Mellow takes a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Hugh travels to Cornwall to join a group of fisherman who have found a sustainable and lucrative market in line caught squid fishing. After an early morning at sea, Hugh cooks the men deep fried salt and pepper squid with a sweet chilli dipping sauce before the rest of their catch travels to Londons sushi restaurants. Hughs campaign to get more rabbits back in the culinary food chain is picked up and championed by chef Tim Maddams. His first task is to persuade his local curry house not only to experiment with spicy rabbits, but to confidently stick them on their menu. The Landshare campaign, which matches landowners who have land to spare with would-be growers, continues to capture the imagination of the nation. Hugh visits a community who have benefited from the match and are determined to continue to grow and rear their own produce. Chilli and pumpkin night arrives and Hugh has squashes to pickle, chillies to roast and pumpkins to mash in the frenzied run up to this fiery evening.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>

He follows the production of pocket-sprung mattresses from the arrival of hard steel right through to soft bedding heading out of dispatch. Along the way he learns how lengths of metal are stretched into thin wire and coiled into springs which are placed into individual pockets. And how the mattresses are designed to wick sweat away from our bodies with the help of natural fibres like hemp and wool. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is learning whether there are benefits to be had from taking an afternoon nap. She meets up with a sleep scientist who tells her that we should be making time for a snooze rather than reaching for a cup of coffee. To prove his point, he runs an experiment which demonstrates that reaction times can be improved by a short sleep. 20 minutes is the optimum nap time - any longer risks falling in to a deep sleep which is difficult to wake from.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.3.</episode-num></programme>

A lone gun man, Michael Ryan, opened fire on villagers killing sixteen people and injuring a further fifteen. Known locally as a quite, reserved young man the devastation was one of the largest crimes to hit Britain. It took Police hours to contain him as he randomly fired at neighbours through the picturesque streets. His reign of terror eventually came to a head in his local school. Ryan barricaded himself in and ended his life taking his motive to the grave with him. This documentary tells of that chilling day through the eyes of people at the centre of the tragedy. Alison Chapman was a young girl who got shot by Ryan. The crazed gun man opened fire on Alison and her mum as they were travelling in their car. Doctors had to battle for hours to save their lives.

A lone gun man, Michael Ryan, opened fire on villagers killing sixteen people and injuring a further fifteen. Known locally as a quite, reserved young man the devastation was one of the largest crimes to hit Britain. It took Police hours to contain him as he randomly fired at neighbours through the picturesque streets. His reign of terror eventually came to a head in his local school. Ryan barricaded himself in and ended his life taking his motive to the grave with him. This documentary tells of that chilling day through the eyes of people at the centre of the tragedy. Alison Chapman was a young girl who got shot by Ryan. The crazed gun man opened fire on Alison and her mum as they were travelling in their car. Doctors had to battle for hours to save their lives.

We-ll find out if his problem has been straightened out for good. Dr Christian catches up with Emily, a young girl who was suffering for years with a bowel problem and since the programme has been given a diagnosis which means she-ll have to change her diet for the rest of her life.
