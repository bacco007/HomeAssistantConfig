Uniting a cast of mega beauties such as Christie Brinkley, Christy Turlington, Cheryl Tiegs, Jerry Hall, Isabella Rossellini and Paulina Porizkova, filmmaker Timothy Greenfield-Sanders explores the hidden ugly side of the beauty industry, and the faces which made it such a fascination. This documentary reveals the stories behind the magazine covers, displaying these multicultural pioneers as they are: beautiful, candid, courageous and outspoken. Each woman shares her experiences, ideas on longevity and philosophy of life in the fashion industry. About Face celebrates the raw intelligence and staying power of these timeless icons and doesnt shy away from asking tough questions which plague the fashion industry: sexual harassment, racism, plastic surgery and body image.

Jesus Camp, directed by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady (The Boys of Baraka), follows Levi, Rachael, and Tory to Paster Becky Fischers "Kids on Fire" summer camp in Devils Lake, North Dakota, where kids as young as six-years-old are taught to become dedicated Christian soldiers in "Gods army." The Film follows these children at camp as they hone their "prophetic gifts" and are schooled in how to "take back America for Christ." The film is a first-ever look into an intense training ground that recruits born-again Christian children to become an active part of Americas political future.</desc></programme>

Each woman shares her experiences, ideas on longevity and philosophy of life in the fashion industry. About Face celebrates the raw intelligence and staying power of these timeless icons and doesnt shy away from asking tough questions which plague the fashion industry: sexual harassment, racism, plastic surgery and body image. This is modelling as youve never seen it before.</desc></programme>

Jesus Camp, directed by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady (The Boys of Baraka), follows Levi, Rachael, and Tory to Paster Becky Fischers "Kids on Fire" summer camp in Devils Lake, North Dakota, where kids as young as six-years-old are taught to become dedicated Christian soldiers in "Gods army." The Film follows these children at camp as they hone their "prophetic gifts" and are schooled in how to "take back America for Christ." The film is a first-ever look into an intense training ground that recruits born-again Christian children to become an active part of Americas political future.</desc></programme>

Miami, once a modest, coastal, melting-pot city, was transformed almost overnight into a glitzy metropolis when it became the main point of entry for cocaine into the USA. Chronicling the drug influx of the 1970s and 80s and the resulting gang wars and violence, this is an eye-opening profile of the Miami underworld. Featuring candid interviews with key figures on both sides of the law, it paints a picture of a city overrun by drugs and warring gangs. Taking centrestage are ex-drug dealers/smugglers Jon Roberts and Mickey Munday, who lay out the structure behind the production, import and sale of cocaine, as well as providing their own reminiscences on the excessive heyday of Miamis vice. When the drug business boomed - Miami banks almost ran out of space to store cash deposits - violence inevitably followed. An inside perspective is provided by Jorge Rivi Alaya, a convicted former hit man for Griselda Blanco, the notoriously bloodthirsty Colombian godmother.</desc></programme>

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.21.</episode-num></programme>

In The Listening Road, youll ride along on one mans remarkable 33-day journey cycling 3,000 miles across the United States on a mission to engage with people from all walks of life in real conversations about things that matter most. As a pastor, Neil Tomba noticed a disturbing trend among people in church: they were finding it increasingly difficult to talk about God to those outside of the church. Neil wanted to practice what he preached, so he set out to bike across the United States, talking - and, more importantly, listening - to strangers from all walks of life about faith, their stories, and matters of the heart. The Listening Road takes you on Neils remarkable journey across the country and straight into its soul - from Route 66 motels to state parks, a lake house, and a railway car; from conversations with Amish farmers to chats with truckers, cowboys, mechanics, and a descendant of Daniel Boone. From one city, farm, and highway to the next, Neil models with compassion and curiosity that genuine connection happens only if we are willing to listen in love.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.5.</episode-num></programme>

San Francisco is also the home of sourdough and where Americas love affair with seasonal cooking took hold. Particularly important to the spread of this philosophy were groundbreaking restaurants like Chez Panisse, run by the legendary Alice Waters, who Rick is keen to meet. But it is also where he got his first taste of Mexican food. Enchiladas, guacamole and burritos were no longer names he had only heard on the radio, so the food of Mexico, an essential part of his culinary imagination, became real.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num></programme>

This was looking unlikely until they found an inexpensive block on a ridge above a freeway at Ocean Shores (near Byron). Now all they need is an architecture firm inventive enough to design them a stylish home for very little money. Their modest, forward-thinking philosophy is helpful as they naturally veer away from lavish floor plans and luxurious finishes in favour of the compact, simple, open, sustainable and economical. Working within a tenuous loan framework what they get, apart from stress, is quite fantastic.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.4.</episode-num></programme>

So when electrician and stay-at-home dad Tom and his doctor wife Zewlan decided to build their new home in Ocean Shores, size was everything. Their plan is for a solar passive family home with three modest bedrooms that maximise potential views; small, beautiful spaces on a firm budget of $350,000. With the help of award-winning architects Melanie and James, theyve come up with a design based on the three Ss: small, simple and straightforward. Built out of chipboard, the house will be just half the size of the average Australian home. In a simple layout, three modest bedrooms will connect to one long outside/inside corridor running the length of the house and open underneath, like a deck. The lounge, kitchen and mezzanine will all be easily closed off with huge sliding glass. Toms biggest concern is for the finishes after the exposed chipboard is damaged by some wet weather, hes keen to get the roof on. Will financial pressure and some inclement weather force a re-think or will he and Zewlan stay true to their small house philosophy?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.5.</episode-num></programme>

Ask any detective - they will tell you that if they dont have a lead, a suspect or an arrest within 48 hours, their chances of solving the case are cut in half. In a visual style that feels more like a TV drama than a verite reality show, this program follows homicide detectives during these initial critical hours as they race against time to solve their cases. The program follows various detectives of a few select homicide teams as they track breaking cases - each with a running clock that builds pace as the 48 hours inexorably expires. In this episode, an innocent mother is viciously murdered with a butcher knife. In Atlanta, a beloved patriarch is gunned down when a game of dominoes turns deadly.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">18.10.</episode-num></programme>

Ask any detective - they will tell you that if they dont have a lead, a suspect or an arrest within 48 hours, their chances of solving the case are cut in half. In a visual style that feels more like a TV drama than a verite reality show, this program follows homicide detectives during these initial critical hours as they race against time to solve their cases. The program follows various detectives of a few select homicide teams as they track breaking cases - each with a running clock that builds pace as the 48 hours inexorably expires.

The team is here to help the new owners, who have saved the house from dereliction, to find out what has gone on in their garden over the centuries. Its full of tantalising glimpses of archaeology: a medieval wall with a window, carved stones, and what looks like the remains of a Norman castle. Sorting this lot out is the kind of challenge the team cant resist. Over three days they discover this remarkable piece of land contains over 600 years of archaeology. It may seem run-down now, but it once belonged to one of the most powerful families in medieval Britain, the Greys. Monumental walls and grand manors emerge from the trenches as Tony is joined by historian and international bestselling author Philippa Gregory to piece together the intriguing tale of this power-hungry family. He discovers a dynasty that arrived with William the Conqueror and went on to produce two queens of England: Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.6.</episode-num></programme>

The massive castle that dominates the shore today is a Tudor structure built on earlier foundations, and its that early castle, built by King John, that the team is looking for. Unfortunately, everything is built on top of a rock outcrop with the steepest sides the archaeologists have ever encountered, and they have to employ mountaineers to help get them and their equipment up the sheer slopes; its not an excavation for the faint-hearted. As the dig continues, shadows of that original castle are discovered and a story emerges of how Mont Orgueil came to symbolise Jersey and the Channel Islands peculiar relationship with Britain and France. It was fought over, lost, and won back again for centuries, but the massive stone walls that the team uncover ultimately proved futile against the might of gunpowder.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.7.</episode-num></programme>

Tony Robinson and his band are here at the request of the Reverend William Burke, vicar of the historic St Kyneburghas church in Castor, Cambridgeshire. Under very close supervision, the team must dodge the thousands of burials in the graveyard to get to an ornate mosaic floor that was reportedly discovered almost 200 years ago. It could be the missing link in a village that is crammed with massive Roman walls and old reports of exquisite finds. Could they all belong to one vast building, dubbed a Praetorium, that would have dominated the Roman skyline and the whole region? The team fan out through the village to dig up gardens and playing fields and locate the different pieces of the jigsaw.

Tony Robinson and his band are here at the request of the Reverend William Burke, vicar of the historic St Kyneburghas church in Castor, Cambridgeshire. Under very close supervision, the team must dodge the thousands of burials in the graveyard to get to an ornate mosaic floor that was reportedly discovered almost 200 years ago. It could be the missing link in a village that is crammed with massive Roman walls and old reports of exquisite finds. Could they all belong to one vast building, dubbed a Praetorium, that would have dominated the Roman skyline and the whole region? The team fan out through the village to dig up gardens and playing fields and locate the different pieces of the jigsaw. Can they reach the mosaic under the burials and convince the sceptics that theyve found a building the size of a Roman palace?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.5.</episode-num></programme>

The massive castle that dominates the shore today is a Tudor structure built on earlier foundations, and its that early castle, built by King John, that the team is looking for. Unfortunately, everything is built on top of a rock outcrop with the steepest sides the archaeologists have ever encountered, and they have to employ mountaineers to help get them and their equipment up the sheer slopes; its not an excavation for the faint-hearted. As the dig continues, shadows of that original castle are discovered and a story emerges of how Mont Orgueil came to symbolise Jersey and the Channel Islands peculiar relationship with Britain and France. It was fought over, lost, and won back again for centuries, but the massive stone walls that the team uncover ultimately proved futile against the might of gunpowder.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.7.</episode-num></programme>
