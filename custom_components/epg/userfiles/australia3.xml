He invites Lucas to scour the items to see what he can get good money for, as hed like to be able to give his adult children some much needed cash. On Sydney Harbour Lucas has arranged to meet two divers who collect bottles. They dig deep below the sandy bottom of the harbour to find pieces that stretch back to Sydneys colonial days. Lucas realises there could be good money in their pieces, so he visits a bottle fair to talk to the experts, where he learns that some bottles sell for as much as $20,000 each! Meanwhile, Lucas gets a call from Bill - who has an 1820s bibles the he thinks could be worth big bucks - but some classic mid-century chairs rotting in the weather in Bills backyard catch Lucas eye while hes there.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.4.</episode-num></programme>

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.27.</episode-num></programme>

They sample some great food, visit well known sites, and experience fun activities such as white water rafting and indoor skydiving. Most importantly, they meet a host of extraordinary women, young and old, and talk about identity, purpose, relationships, beauty, choices, and much more. Throughout their travels, Jeni and Sarah will have fun, but they will always bring each episode back to one central theme: teaching young ladies about Gods grace in their lives and addressing relevant issues in a redemptive way. Jeni: Seeking the Extraordinary is different than other youth-oriented reality TV for many reasons and will stand out as a positive, biblically-based alternative to many of the secular reality shows that depict todays youth in a negative light. It offers another option for reality TV fans that love the genre but are turned off by the reckless behaviour and non-existent values system of most secular reality-based programming. In a time when immorality, irreverence, and confusion have become ordinary, Jeni: Seeking the Extraordinary will always take the high road to the extraordinary.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num></programme>

This can cause a major paradigm shift as people reevaluate everything in their life including their belief system, relationships, what they value and how they approach daily life. Being confronted with pain, death or the threat of life can force someone to reassess their understanding and worldview as well as reconsider what is truly important. It shakes up the why and what we live for everyday and can propel a person into a new way of being and interacting with the world. Artist, Jess Le Clercs story captures how finding new meaning after escaping death has caused her to reinvent her life to find renewed purpose and authenticity. Psychologically, this process of renewal and re-creation doesnt always happen in an instant, it often involves wrestling in dark places with an unknown end. But once on the other side of the tunnel, life is viewed with a new perspective which can take time for others to adjust to.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.0.</episode-num></programme>

Until a brutal rape and murder destroys that dream for one resident, 84-year-old retired psychiatrist Gladys Conrad. Police are left scrambling to find her killer and a motive for murder. With no valuables taken from the scene and no signs of forced entry, investigators think it could be an inside job committed by a violent sexual predator. Challenged by a severe lack of evidence, investigators catch a major break that becomes the lynch pin of the investigation - the killers DNA profile. An unrelated sexual assault attempt in Los Angeles, three years after Conrads murder, gives them a DNA match and a composite sketch of the killer. But they still dont have a name. Years later a suspect arrested on unrelated charges turns out to have the same DNA profile as both the Conrad and LA cases. But before the detectives can track him down, he is deported to Mexico. At every turn the investigation hits a snag but the detectives refuse to give up, haunted by the vicious murder of a defenceless elderly woman.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.1.</episode-num></programme>

In 1997, Leslie Camilleri and Lindsay Becket abducted two teenagers: 14-year-old Lauren Barry and 16-year-old Nichole Collins. The girls were camping with friends only a few kilometres from home when they decided to leave the camp to visit friends. As they emerged from the bush, they were picked up by Camilleri and Beckett. They were driven across the state of Victoria and subjected to nine hours of rape and torture. After the harrowing ordeal, the two friends were stabbed to death and buried in scrubland near Fiddlers Green Creek. Their brutal and heartbreaking deaths still shock the nation to this day. Camilleri was imprisoned with no chance of release. Beckett was sentenced to a minimum of 35 years in prison. This documentary includes interviews with friends and relatives of the two girls including Laurens brother Nathan and friends Rebecca Barber and Sarah (surname withheld). The program also includes a revealing interview with the detective who led the investigation, who details how the killers were tracked down and convicted of the notorious crime.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.1.</episode-num></programme>

That is, until gunfire rips through two city parks popular for cruising, leaving two men dead and one critically wounded. Police race to determine a connection between the cases and a motive for the murders. The investigation is complicated. The crime scenes are messy. The media attention is glaring. The second victim is a former state senator embroiled in an FBI investigation for fraud. Detectives wonder if an embittered foe sought revenge or if it was the victims homosexuality that made him a target. After a composite sketch is released and a ballistics report confirms that the same type of gun executed both murders, a key suspect is fingered. When the police receive an anonymous letter from The Aids Commission, an anti-gay group, that takes responsibility for the murders, the investigators turn their attention to a different suspect.

That is, until gunfire rips through two city parks popular for cruising, leaving two men dead and one critically wounded. Police race to determine a connection between the cases and a motive for the murders. The investigation is complicated. The crime scenes are messy. The media attention is glaring. The second victim is a former state senator embroiled in an FBI investigation for fraud. Detectives wonder if an embittered foe sought revenge or if it was the victims homosexuality that made him a target. After a composite sketch is released and a ballistics report confirms that the same type of gun executed both murders, a key suspect is fingered. When the police receive an anonymous letter from The Aids Commission, an anti-gay group, that takes responsibility for the murders, the investigators turn their attention to a different suspect.

The police rush to establish motive and solve the towns first murders in over a century. The CSI unit combs the scene and finds nothing valuable is missing. However, blood splatter analysis shows they are looking for more than one killer. The family rumour mill points to the black sheep of the Stock clan, Matt Livers. Family members say he threatened Wayne the day before the murders. Matt says hes innocent but he fails a polygraph. After hours of intense interrogation he cracks and confesses. Matt also implicates his cousin, Nick Sampson. But two days later Matt recants and the case stalls. That is until investigators focus on a gold ring found on the kitchen floor of the farmhouse. Forensic tests find traces of the victims blood and an unknown womans DNA on the ring. When investigators trace the ring to a stolen truck in Wisconsin and teenage lovers on a drug-fuelled crime spree, suddenly detectives have four prime suspects. To make things worse, there are allegations that investigators planted evidence. Now, not only Murdock, but all of Nebraska wants to know who really murdered Wayne and Sharmon Stock.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.4.</episode-num></programme>

The police rush to establish motive and solve the towns first murders in over a century. The CSI unit combs the scene and finds nothing valuable is missing. However, blood splatter analysis shows they are looking for more than one killer. The family rumour mill points to the black sheep of the Stock clan, Matt Livers. Family members say he threatened Wayne the day before the murders. Matt says hes innocent but he fails a polygraph. After hours of intense interrogation he cracks and confesses. Matt also implicates his cousin, Nick Sampson. But two days later Matt recants and the case stalls. That is until investigators focus on a gold ring found on the kitchen floor of the farmhouse. Forensic tests find traces of the victims blood and an unknown womans DNA on the ring. When investigators trace the ring to a stolen truck in Wisconsin and teenage lovers on a drug-fuelled crime spree, suddenly detectives have four prime suspects. To make things worse, there are allegations that investigators planted evidence. Now, not only Murdock, but all of Nebraska wants to know who really murdered Wayne and Sharmon Stock.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.4.</episode-num></programme>

Until a brutal rape and murder destroys that dream for one resident, 84-year-old retired psychiatrist Gladys Conrad. Police are left scrambling to find her killer and a motive for murder. With no valuables taken from the scene and no signs of forced entry, investigators think it could be an inside job committed by a violent sexual predator. Challenged by a severe lack of evidence, investigators catch a major break that becomes the lynch pin of the investigation - the killers DNA profile. An unrelated sexual assault attempt in Los Angeles, three years after Conrads murder, gives them a DNA match and a composite sketch of the killer. But they still dont have a name. Years later a suspect arrested on unrelated charges turns out to have the same DNA profile as both the Conrad and LA cases. But before the detectives can track him down, he is deported to Mexico. At every turn the investigation hits a snag but the detectives refuse to give up, haunted by the vicious murder of a defenceless elderly woman.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.1.</episode-num></programme>

In 1997, Leslie Camilleri and Lindsay Becket abducted two teenagers: 14-year-old Lauren Barry and 16-year-old Nichole Collins. The girls were camping with friends only a few kilometres from home when they decided to leave the camp to visit friends. As they emerged from the bush, they were picked up by Camilleri and Beckett. They were driven across the state of Victoria and subjected to nine hours of rape and torture. After the harrowing ordeal, the two friends were stabbed to death and buried in scrubland near Fiddlers Green Creek. Their brutal and heartbreaking deaths still shock the nation to this day. Camilleri was imprisoned with no chance of release. Beckett was sentenced to a minimum of 35 years in prison. This documentary includes interviews with friends and relatives of the two girls including Laurens brother Nathan and friends Rebecca Barber and Sarah (surname withheld). The program also includes a revealing interview with the detective who led the investigation, who details how the killers were tracked down and convicted of the notorious crime.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.1.</episode-num></programme>

The police rush to establish motive and solve the towns first murders in over a century. The CSI unit combs the scene and finds nothing valuable is missing. However, blood splatter analysis shows they are looking for more than one killer. The family rumour mill points to the black sheep of the Stock clan, Matt Livers. Family members say he threatened Wayne the day before the murders. Matt says hes innocent but he fails a polygraph. After hours of intense interrogation he cracks and confesses. Matt also implicates his cousin, Nick Sampson. But two days later Matt recants and the case stalls. That is until investigators focus on a gold ring found on the kitchen floor of the farmhouse. Forensic tests find traces of the victims blood and an unknown womans DNA on the ring. When investigators trace the ring to a stolen truck in Wisconsin and teenage lovers on a drug-fuelled crime spree, suddenly detectives have four prime suspects. To make things worse, there are allegations that investigators planted evidence. Now, not only Murdock, but all of Nebraska wants to know who really murdered Wayne and Sharmon Stock.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.4.</episode-num></programme>

Born in Stirling Castle in 1594, he was the eldest son and heir of King James the VI and I of the United Kingdom. From an early age, the young prince was hidden away by the King for security reasons; but later, after he joined his father in England as the first Scottish Prince of Wales, Henry became a mesmerising star of the first decade of the Stuart dynastys rule over the tumultuous 1600s. Paul begins his quest in Stirling Castle and meets historian and author, Sarah Fraser, who helps to uncover Henrys early life, as well as learning about how the lost princes legacy changed history when the British Empire took its first steps into North America, under Henrys patronage.

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze. Often the blaze stoked such animosities that the fires of intrigue and betrayal never went out.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num></programme>

The Japanese simply would not surrender and continued to fight island by island, foxhole by foxhole. The US Air Force commander tried bombing Japan into submission, firebombing Tokyo. Over 200,000 people died, yet still Japan clung on. In the end, President Truman had to go nuclear, and the fates of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were sealed. The films end with Japan subdued and the revelation of Japanese war crimes. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed particularly in the last five to 10 years, when documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict. With the very latest satellite-delivered terrain mapping and state-of-the-art graphics, this story can now be told with the very latest access to information which was not previously available.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.12.</episode-num></programme>
