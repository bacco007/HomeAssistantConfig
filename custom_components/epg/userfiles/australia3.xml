This is a challenging task for the employees of Parks Canada, as they have to reconcile tourism and economic interests with nature. And then, of course, there is climate change. Whether and how these developments are putting a strain on sensitive ecosystems will be the main topic of the discovery series, which brings Canadas unique landscape and culture to life.

The over 100-year-old concept of Canadian National Parks is instrumental in protecting the unique natural environment and habitats of native flora and fauna from human influence. This is a challenging task for the employees of Parks Canada, as they have to reconcile tourism and economic interests with nature. And then, of course, there is climate change. Whether and how these developments are putting a strain on sensitive ecosystems will be the main topic of the discovery series, which brings Canadas unique landscape and culture to life. Knowledgeable and charismatic protagonists, including scientists, First Nations people, environmental activists, artists and storytellers who have a special connection with the landscape guide the viewer through this journey.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>

Assuming the blame for the death of DA Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act.

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.27.</episode-num></programme>

Committing to this new purpose brought her initially in conflict with the Catholic Church and the Government of India. Undaunted by the obstacles and challenges of her new calling, she rose to become viewed by many as the greatest humanitarian of modern time. Letters from Mother Teresa tells the story of how this tiny figure of a woman changed hearts, lives and inspired millions. Though she herself grew to feel an isolation and an abandonment by God, she said she saw God in every human being. The movie explores the life of Mother Teresa (Juliet Stevenson) through letters she wrote to her longtime friend and spiritual advisor, Father Celeste van Exem (Max von Sydow) over a nearly fifty-year period.</desc></programme>

In the 18th century a spiritual and cultural revolution swept across Great Britain and her American colonies. The marvel of this revolution was the son of a Tavern keeper. Out of these humble beginnings came a powerful voice proclaiming the new birth being Born Again. Whitefields voice startled the church like a trumpet blast. His theatrical persuasion transformed the pulpit into sacred theatre. He took the church outdoors and preached to tens of thousands at a time from Moorfields in London to Boston Common in the American colonies. He lifted his voice to preach to the spiritually starving masses and ignited the Evangelical Revival and the First Great Awakening. Whitefield was the most famous man of his time. He crossed the Atlantic 13 times, preached 18 thousand sermons to an estimated 10 million people. He brought about massive social, political, and spiritual transformation in the Transatlantic world with his message .</desc></programme>

Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more.

We choose, think, pray, and feel our way down a road of desires and intentional acts that bring us to our destination.

For seventeen years, host, Mitch Kruse was owner, CEO, and auctioneer for Kruse International, the worlds largest collector car sales organisation. Today, Mitch writes and speaks to a wide array of audiences and on The Restoration Road offers sound biblical teaching exploring wisdom, leadership and restoration.

Until a brutal rape and murder destroys that dream for one resident, 84-year-old retired psychiatrist Gladys Conrad. Police are left scrambling to find her killer and a motive for murder. With no valuables taken from the scene and no signs of forced entry, investigators think it could be an inside job committed by a violent sexual predator. Challenged by a severe lack of evidence, investigators catch a major break that becomes the lynch pin of the investigation - the killers DNA profile. An unrelated sexual assault attempt in Los Angeles, three years after Conrads murder, gives them a DNA match and a composite sketch of the killer. But they still dont have a name. Years later a suspect arrested on unrelated charges turns out to have the same DNA profile as both the Conrad and LA cases. But before the detectives can track him down, he is deported to Mexico. At every turn the investigation hits a snag but the detectives refuse to give up, haunted by the vicious murder of a defenceless elderly woman.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.1.</episode-num></programme>

They were driven across the state of Victoria and subjected to nine hours of rape and torture. After the harrowing ordeal, the two friends were stabbed to death and buried in scrubland near Fiddlers Green Creek. Their brutal and heartbreaking deaths still shock the nation to this day. Camilleri was imprisoned with no chance of release. Beckett was sentenced to a minimum of 35 years in prison. This documentary includes interviews with friends and relatives of the two girls including Laurens brother Nathan and friends Rebecca Barber and Sarah (surname withheld). The program also includes a revealing interview with the detective who led the investigation, who details how the killers were tracked down and convicted of the notorious crime.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.1.</episode-num></programme>

Until a brutal rape and murder destroys that dream for one resident, 84-year-old retired psychiatrist Gladys Conrad. Police are left scrambling to find her killer and a motive for murder. With no valuables taken from the scene and no signs of forced entry, investigators think it could be an inside job committed by a violent sexual predator. Challenged by a severe lack of evidence, investigators catch a major break that becomes the lynch pin of the investigation - the killers DNA profile. An unrelated sexual assault attempt in Los Angeles, three years after Conrads murder, gives them a DNA match and a composite sketch of the killer. But they still dont have a name. Years later a suspect arrested on unrelated charges turns out to have the same DNA profile as both the Conrad and LA cases. But before the detectives can track him down, he is deported to Mexico. At every turn the investigation hits a snag but the detectives refuse to give up, haunted by the vicious murder of a defenceless elderly woman.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.1.</episode-num></programme>

The second victim is a former state senator embroiled in an FBI investigation for fraud. Detectives wonder if an embittered foe sought revenge or if it was the victims homosexuality that made him a target. After a composite sketch is released and a ballistics report confirms that the same type of gun executed both murders, a key suspect is fingered. When the police receive an anonymous letter from The Aids Commission, an anti-gay group, that takes responsibility for the murders, the investigators turn their attention to a different suspect.

The second victim is a former state senator embroiled in an FBI investigation for fraud. Detectives wonder if an embittered foe sought revenge or if it was the victims homosexuality that made him a target. After a composite sketch is released and a ballistics report confirms that the same type of gun executed both murders, a key suspect is fingered. When the police receive an anonymous letter from The Aids Commission, an anti-gay group, that takes responsibility for the murders, the investigators turn their attention to a different suspect.

Flames fill the cockpit and the aircraft plummets in a wild spin. But time and again the pilot of a P-47 Thunderbolt pulls out and keeps on fighting. Over occupied Europe, the P-47 Thunderbolt blazed a reputation as the most rugged fighter of WWII. Pilot Robert S Johnson flies with the renowned 56th fighter group. His flight is jumped by 16 deadly Focke-Wulf 190s. As hundreds of enemy rounds impact his fighter, Johnsons life depends on the legendary protection his armoured cockpit affords. In June 1944, Lt George Sutcliffe enters the fight of his life in an effort to escape 40-plus Me109s looming above him. The Thunderbolts defensive capabilities inspired confidence in its pilots. But the aircraft was a dogfighter at heart.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.15.</episode-num></programme>

The Japanese were driven back across the ocean, island by island, in savage hand-to-hand fighting. American dominance at sea was finally established in the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot, when radar gave the US Navy Advance warning of a huge Japanese attack and the last vestiges of Japanese naval air power were destroyed. But this film also looks at the war in the jungles, in places such as Burma, where new specialist fighting units - like Ord Wingates Chindits - slowly pushed back the Japanese despite horrific conditions. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed particularly in the last five to 10 years, when documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict. With the very latest satellite-delivered terrain mapping and state-of-the-art graphics, this story can now be told with the very latest access to information which was not previously available.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.10.</episode-num></programme>

Flames fill the cockpit and the aircraft plummets in a wild spin. But time and again the pilot of a P-47 Thunderbolt pulls out and keeps on fighting. Over occupied Europe, the P-47 Thunderbolt blazed a reputation as the most rugged fighter of WWII. Pilot Robert S Johnson flies with the renowned 56th fighter group. His flight is jumped by 16 deadly Focke-Wulf 190s. As hundreds of enemy rounds impact his fighter, Johnsons life depends on the legendary protection his armoured cockpit affords. In June 1944, Lt George Sutcliffe enters the fight of his life in an effort to escape 40-plus Me109s looming above him. The Thunderbolts defensive capabilities inspired confidence in its pilots. But the aircraft was a dogfighter at heart.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.15.</episode-num></programme>

The Japanese were driven back across the ocean, island by island, in savage hand-to-hand fighting. American dominance at sea was finally established in the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot, when radar gave the US Navy Advance warning of a huge Japanese attack and the last vestiges of Japanese naval air power were destroyed. But this film also looks at the war in the jungles, in places such as Burma, where new specialist fighting units - like Ord Wingates Chindits - slowly pushed back the Japanese despite horrific conditions. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed particularly in the last five to 10 years, when documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict.
