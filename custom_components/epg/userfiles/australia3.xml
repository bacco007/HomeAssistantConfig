That controversy was swiftly followed up with a series of antisemitic statements on social media. With his dangerous statements making global headlines, Ye doubled down by sharing dangerous and inflammatory mistruths during a series of interviews. In the face of backlash, Ye told the paparazzi that he was planning to run for president of the United States in 2024. Unfolding against the backdrop of Yes recent behaviour and his rumoured 2024 presidential campaign, this documentary sees award-winning journalist Mobeen Azhar travel to the United States to try and discover how one of Americas most celebrated artists became a megaphone for hate and division.</desc></programme>

However, if this continues as the business grows, that leader will find themselves feeling tired, lonely and without hope. Peter talks with Kent Medwin about the idea of servant leadership - where a leader is proactively working to empower the success of the team as it grows. Kent shares how without this approach, where instead the leader holds onto making all decisions, they become a significant barrier to success. Peter and the team unpack the value that decentralised decision making creates a culture of empowerment and whilst it can be slow to get started, slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.9.</episode-num></programme>

Maeve visits the inspiring Ricupero family who settled in Jarrahdale outside Perth, where they grow vegetables on a large scale and bake 140 loaves of bread every two weeks in the huge oven they built themselves - the crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside pane di casa so adored by Italians. Guy then shows a recipe for delicious bruschetta, using day-old bread. Guy joins olive oil producer Joe Grilli from Primo Estate in McLaren Vale at harvest time and learns about mixing oils for the perfect blend. Vongole harvester Tony Petruzzelli takes us to work as he rakes waist-deep in water off Adelaides outer harbour, then Sydney chef Eugenio Maiale cooks up the classic spaghetti alla vongole, the one dish that he always keeps on his menu at his popular inner-city restaurant A Tavola. For sweets, the crunchy fried biscuit cannoli filled with fresh ricotta is close to heaven, especially when its made by second-generation Sicilian sweets master Achille Mellini from Grossi Florentino.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num></programme>

For that simple reason, locals casually refer to the city as Mexico, and not much has changed to the food that fed the former seat of the Aztec Empire. Scenes captured by Diego Rivera in his murals still come alive in the citys bustling markets, and working mens taverns still offer pulque, the alco-pop of the ancients. But the most precious Aztec legacy are the chinampas - floating vegetable gardens found in the criss-crossing intersections of canals to the south of the city. They are an inspiration to the citys top chefs, including Eduardo Garcia, endearingly known as chef Lalo. Heading south from the capital, Rick travels to the city of Puebla, which conjures up images of Cortez and the Spanish conquest of Mexico. It is a city with impressive European architecture, talavera pottery and the home of mole, Mexicos most famous meat stew. Finally, Rick travels to the deserts of Oaxaca, where mezcal, one of the countrys most iconic drinks, is produced.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.4.</episode-num></programme>

At first, the home of an 80-year-old widow goes up in flames. Ten days later, an assailant seriously beats an elderly couple and sets fire to their living room. Another fire leaves a 72-year-old woman dead in her mobile home. And days later, a 79-year-old woman is brutally raped before her mobile home is torched. With all signs pointing to a serial killer with a taste for elderly women and fire, local and state police join forces with the FBI.

At dawn on May 10, 1940, Germany conducted historys first glider-borne assault against Fort Eben Emael. Despite powerful guns and heavy armour, the Belgians neglected to defend the roof where nine flimsy, fabric-covered gliders landed and disgorged 71 paratroopers. Using computer graphics, archive footage, and reconstruction shot in the passageways and tunnels, we examine how the fortress fell so easily.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.5.</episode-num></programme>
