In The Listening Road, youll ride along on one mans remarkable 33-day journey cycling 3,000 miles across the United States on a mission to engage with people from all walks of life in real conversations about things that matter most. As a pastor, Neil Tomba noticed a disturbing trend among people in church: they were finding it increasingly difficult to talk about God to those outside of the church. Neil wanted to practice what he preached, so he set out to bike across the United States, talking - and, more importantly, listening - to strangers from all walks of life about faith, their stories, and matters of the heart. The Listening Road takes you on Neils remarkable journey across the country and straight into its soul - from Route 66 motels to state parks, a lake house, and a railway car; from conversations with Amish farmers to chats with truckers, cowboys, mechanics, and a descendant of Daniel Boone. From one city, farm, and highway to the next, Neil models with compassion and curiosity that genuine connection happens only if we are willing to listen in love.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.4.</episode-num></programme>

The others were John Travers and Michael Murdoch. Michael Murphy, 33 at the time of the murder, was the eldest of the nine Murphy children. He had been sent to live with his grandmother at 12 years of age. His brother Gary Murphy was five years younger. Hearing impairment affected Garys schooling, and he left early to seek work. His strong interest in cars led to him facing several automotive theft-related charges in the years before the murder. He was also known to have a very violent temper. Leslie Joseph Murphy was the youngest of the Murphy children but was known as having the worst temperament. He had faced childrens court on many occasions for a number of theft-related offences and was 24 at the time of the Cobby murder. Travers was a depraved 18-year-old who had grown up in a dysfunctional family in the outer suburbs of Sydney. He mingled his blood with best mate Michael Murdoch in a ceremony that made them so-called blood brothers. The five are serving life sentences for the murder.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.4.</episode-num></programme>

The others were John Travers and Michael Murdoch. Michael Murphy, 33 at the time of the murder, was the eldest of the nine Murphy children. He had been sent to live with his grandmother at 12 years of age. His brother Gary Murphy was five years younger. Hearing impairment affected Garys schooling, and he left early to seek work. His strong interest in cars led to him facing several automotive theft-related charges in the years before the murder. He was also known to have a very violent temper. Leslie Joseph Murphy was the youngest of the Murphy children but was known as having the worst temperament. He had faced childrens court on many occasions for a number of theft-related offences and was 24 at the time of the Cobby murder. Travers was a depraved 18-year-old who had grown up in a dysfunctional family in the outer suburbs of Sydney. He mingled his blood with best mate Michael Murdoch in a ceremony that made them so-called blood brothers. The five are serving life sentences for the murder.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.4.</episode-num></programme>

Stalin emerged as the true victor of the Second World War, having gained a vast Empire in the East.

The team are intrigued by metal detecting finds and pottery scattered across the fields, which suggest theyre on the site of a high-status Anglo Saxon burial ground. By the end of the first day theres no sign of a cemetery, in spite of the evidence. But all that changes the next morning with a flurry of activity revealing burials, cremations and a glimpse of gold. Days of frantic digging reveal every type of Anglo-Saxon burial - and perhaps the finest piece of jewellery ever discovered on the program.

Dr Dawns in the mobile clinic on the beach, and her first patient is Russell, with a huge protrusion that hes kept under wraps for 10 years. Meanwhile, Dr Christian and Dr Pixie hit the night-time bars and clubs to find frisky young Brits. Theyre armed with a new rapid test for chlamydia, the number one sexually transmitted infection. Back in the UK, Dr Pixie sees a young woman with two wombs who wants advice on carrying a baby, and a 20-year-old with inflamed tonsils that she has to clean out with a cotton bud. Dr Dawn helps a woman whos been sitting on her embarrassing rectal prolapse for a decade, and Dr Christian tackles a worrying case of warts. The doctors also meet a woman living with an extraordinary condition that means her left leg is permanently clenched up by her hip. Finally, Dr Dawn addresses the stigma of bowel cancer - by testing her own poo for signs of the disease.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.0.</episode-num></programme>
