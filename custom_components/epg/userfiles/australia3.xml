They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.26.</episode-num></programme>

Shes done a great job, but her dedication has meant her friendships and her bigger career goals have suffered. On New Years Eve, her best friends AJ, Lisa and Jackson, pressure her to make a New Years resolution: to say yes to any social invitation offered to her, no matter the event. The end date of this resolution is her thirtieth birthday in one months time. Much to her chagrin, her production team, looking for an extended New Years story for the show, decides to follow her for the month. The resolution coincides with Kelly meeting Tom Malone, a marketing director at the regional office of Imperium National Bank, and the two have an immediate mutual attraction. Tom is a confirmed Yes man who just might hold the key to her biggest story, and to her heart.</desc></programme>

Rachels two-year-old son, Alex, witnessed the attack. A passer-by found Rachels body, with Alex clinging to her side, repeatedly saying, "wake up mummy, wake up." A huge police investigation followed. The police didnt have many clues as to who carried out the murder, but they centred their investigation around one man, Colin Stagg. They began Operation Edzell, later described as a honey-trap, which involved an undercover female officer, Lizzie James, feigning a five-month relationship to try to coax the truth out of Stagg. By 1994 the police were convinced that they had enough evidence to send him to trial, but the judge at the Old Bailey threw the case out, saying it was the deceptive conduct of the grossest kind. Colin Stagg never completely escaped suspicion (even up to 15 years later), and in 2007 he received over 700,000 pounds in compensation. A fresh investigation uncovered new evidence and DNA tied serial killer Robert Napper to the crime.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.1.</episode-num></programme>

Rachels two-year-old son, Alex, witnessed the attack. A passer-by found Rachels body, with Alex clinging to her side, repeatedly saying, "wake up mummy, wake up." A huge police investigation followed. The police didnt have many clues as to who carried out the murder, but they centred their investigation around one man, Colin Stagg. They began Operation Edzell, later described as a honey-trap, which involved an undercover female officer, Lizzie James, feigning a five-month relationship to try to coax the truth out of Stagg. By 1994 the police were convinced that they had enough evidence to send him to trial, but the judge at the Old Bailey threw the case out, saying it was the deceptive conduct of the grossest kind. Colin Stagg never completely escaped suspicion (even up to 15 years later), and in 2007 he received over 700,000 pounds in compensation. A fresh investigation uncovered new evidence and DNA tied serial killer Robert Napper to the crime.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.1.</episode-num></programme>

The crime scene yields few clues, and with no signs of forced entry, investigators conclude the victim knew her killer. With a staggering list of possible suspects, including hundreds of former employees, the victims husband, and an eccentric cat-loving couple, investigators are baffled, and the case eventually goes cold.

Shot twice in the head before being set ablaze, the victim is David Stevens, an amateur bodybuilder and Nebraska native. But just who would want to kill the man described by friends as a naive and easygoing "good ole boy"? The only clue for investigators, Stevens unkempt bed, reveals he had sex with a mystery woman hours before he was murdered. A voodoo priestess, a stripper, and an ex-con make the list of possible suspects. When the investigation stalls, the victims family hires their own private investigator. After a series of false leads, the bizarre case eventually goes cold - that is, until a woman makes a sensational confession, and a sordid tale of jealousy, sex, and cold-blooded murder is finally revealed.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.11.</episode-num></programme>

An unidentified young woman is discovered by the side of the road, naked, raped, strangled to death, and thrown out like a piece of trash. Police have few clues but waste little time investigating this haunting crime. DNA matches the victim to 18-year-old Shannon Conway, a troubled teenage runaway who was living out of a sleeping bag among the hippies and transients on San Diegos Ocean Beach. An initial sweep zeroes in on several suspects. Tim Arman, Shannons ex-boyfriend, is still bitter that she dumped him a year ago. Keith Martin, a hobo living out of his van, is known as an angry Vietnam vet with a grudge against women. Martins van, eerily splattered with blood, was spotted in the area on the night of the murder. Police become convinced Martin is the killer but they cant forensically link him to the crime. Then a third suspect enters the frame. The day before Shannon was killed, she jumped into a pickup truck with a man she had met minutes before. Despite three strong leads, the San Diego Homicide struggle to put all the pieces together. Until over a decade later, new advances in DNA testing help cold case investigators finally find Shannons killer and give closure to her heart-broken mother.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.2.</episode-num></programme>

Twenty-nine people, including a pregnant woman and her two unborn babies, died as a result. Victims included children, Catholics and Protestants, and visitors from the Republic of Ireland and Spain. Three days after the attack, the Real IRA (RIRA) claimed responsibility. Although one man was charged and later convicted with the crime, he was released in 2005 due to evidence that the Gardai had tampered with his interview. To this day, nobody has been convicted for the crime. There have been allegations of a cover-up by the police force on both sides of the border, and of a lacklustre performance in the investigation by the then Royal Ulster Constabulary (now the Police Service of Northern Ireland). A civil case brought by members of the victims families claimed that Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were guilty of the bombings, and they were held liable for 1.6 million pounds of damages.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.2.</episode-num></programme>

Twenty-nine people, including a pregnant woman and her two unborn babies, died as a result. Victims included children, Catholics and Protestants, and visitors from the Republic of Ireland and Spain. Three days after the attack, the Real IRA (RIRA) claimed responsibility. Although one man was charged and later convicted with the crime, he was released in 2005 due to evidence that the Gardai had tampered with his interview. To this day, nobody has been convicted for the crime. There have been allegations of a cover-up by the police force on both sides of the border, and of a lacklustre performance in the investigation by the then Royal Ulster Constabulary (now the Police Service of Northern Ireland). A civil case brought by members of the victims families claimed that Michael McKevitt, Liam Campbell, Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly were guilty of the bombings, and they were held liable for 1.6 million pounds of damages.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.2.</episode-num></programme>

An unidentified young woman is discovered by the side of the road, naked, raped, strangled to death, and thrown out like a piece of trash. Police have few clues but waste little time investigating this haunting crime. DNA matches the victim to 18-year-old Shannon Conway, a troubled teenage runaway who was living out of a sleeping bag among the hippies and transients on San Diegos Ocean Beach. An initial sweep zeroes in on several suspects. Tim Arman, Shannons ex-boyfriend, is still bitter that she dumped him a year ago. Keith Martin, a hobo living out of his van, is known as an angry Vietnam vet with a grudge against women. Martins van, eerily splattered with blood, was spotted in the area on the night of the murder. Police become convinced Martin is the killer but they cant forensically link him to the crime. Then a third suspect enters the frame. The day before Shannon was killed, she jumped into a pickup truck with a man she had met minutes before. Despite three strong leads, the San Diego Homicide struggle to put all the pieces together. Until over a decade later, new advances in DNA testing help cold case investigators finally find Shannons killer and give closure to her heart-broken mother.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.2.</episode-num></programme>

Britains Sir Arthur Bomber Harris thought the answer might lie in strategic bombing. The idea was to blow the hell out of Germanys infrastructure and cities. This, he argued, would cripple the Nazis ability to wage a war and the ordinary people would soon lose the will to fight. But it led directly to the tragedy of Dresden, when Allied planes firebombed tens of thousands of ordinary Germans. The Germans believed that the knockout blow would come from their submarines. If they could only cut American supply lines to Britain across the Atlantic, then the Allied effort would collapse. So began a long game of cat-and-mouse between U-boats and British and American convoys. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed, particularly in the last five to 10 years, as documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict.

Britains Sir Arthur Bomber Harris thought the answer might lie in strategic bombing. The idea was to blow the hell out of Germanys infrastructure and cities. This, he argued, would cripple the Nazis ability to wage a war and the ordinary people would soon lose the will to fight. But it led directly to the tragedy of Dresden, when Allied planes firebombed tens of thousands of ordinary Germans. The Germans believed that the knockout blow would come from their submarines. If they could only cut American supply lines to Britain across the Atlantic, then the Allied effort would collapse. So began a long game of cat-and-mouse between U-boats and British and American convoys. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed, particularly in the last five to 10 years, as documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict. With the very latest satellite-delivered terrain mapping and state-of-the-art graphics, this story can now be told with the very latest access to information which was not previously available.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.6.</episode-num></programme>

Ray and Nick are becoming friends and he asks Nick for a favour. Jacinta berates Ray for telling Brittany that Jesus isnt real. The court has ordered Ray to attend anger management. His first meeting doesnt go very well. Freddy informs Ray that the guys he bashed for putting Gary in a coma belong to a crew run by his son-in-laws brother, Davros. Freddy insists Ray sits down with Davros to smooth the waters. Nick makes good on the favour. While on drugs, Vasilli breaks into Garys house to rob the contents of his safe. Gary, who has just returned home from hospital, manages to send an SOS text to Ray who is out shopping with Ally.

Ray and Allys relationship has developed. Freddy takes Ray to meet Davros. Ray doesnt like Davros and although Davros seems placated by the end of the conference, Freddy knows better. A road-rage incident forces Ally to confront Ray about his quick access to violence, rather than attempting to diffuse a situation. When court-ordered anger management therapist Peter confronts Ray about the same impulse, Ray explains that its justifiable to let people clearly know that there are ramifications for being an a******. For Ray, its all about respect. Ray brings Ally home to meet Brittany. Ray cant sleep and gets up to notice a van parked outside surveilling his house. He goes for a drive and leads the van out to a safe place to do some permanent damage to its occupants - Davros guys - using the surprise Gary gave him.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.3.</episode-num></programme>
