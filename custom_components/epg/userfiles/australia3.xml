They are courted by young Senator Obama, who hangs out at Google HQ and pretends to know his coding terms. This awakens the billionaires to their own power, so that they start lobbying - and buying mansions - in Washington DC. But its not all plain sailing: Elon Musks Tesla endeavour nearly bankrupts him during the financial crisis and golden boy Mark Zuckerberg is left sweating on stage when the dark side of tech emerges.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>

Warner: The Last Mogul</title><desc>The epic documentary portrait of the pioneering film producer whose studio, Warner Bros., gave us such Hollywood classics as Little Caesar, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon, Yankee Doodle Dandy, Rebel Without A Cause, My Fair Lady, Bonnie and Clyde and hundreds more. Hailed by reviewers as "one of the best films about a movie studio", Jack L. Warner: The Last Mogul reveals the behind-the-scenes story of the man whom Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, and Bugs Bunny called "boss". Produced by Jack Warners grandson, Emmy Award-nominated filmmaker Gregory Orr, the film provides an insiders access to memories and material never before seen by the public. Included are rare photographs, home movies, Warner Bros. film clips and exclusive interviews that capture the life and times of a Hollywood legend.</desc></programme>

However, if this continues as the business grows, that leader will find themselves feeling tired, lonely and without hope. Peter talks with Kent Medwin about the idea of servant leadership - where a leader is proactively working to empower the success of the team as it grows. Kent shares how without this approach, where instead the leader holds onto making all decisions, they become a significant barrier to success. Peter and the team unpack the value that decentralised decision making creates a culture of empowerment and whilst it can be slow to get started, slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.9.</episode-num></programme>

Presiding over the UKs most revered cooking competition, are new judge and acclaimed chef Anna Haugh, Michelin-starred chef Marcus Wareing and celebrated MasterChef judge, Gregg Wallace, all eager to discover a brand new culinary star. Its the last week of Heats on MasterChef: The Professionals and four new and ambitious chefs set out to prove they have what it takes to win the coveted title. In order to progress in the competition, they must impress in two tests: first the daunting Skills Test, and then, cook two dishes of their own creation in the Signature Menu round. Only the chefs who can demonstrate they could have the all-round skills, technique and flair of a future champion will make it through to the Quarter Final. To kick off, the first two chefs are set a Skills Test by Marcus, who asks them to fillet a sea bream, steam one portion and serve it with an Asian style broth and rice. Who will keep a steady hand when it comes to preparing the delicate fish and prepare a dish packed full of the punchy flavour the judges want, in just 20 minutes?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">14.9.</episode-num></programme>

In 2000 he was convicted of murdering 215 patients by lethal injection. For over 20 years this general practitioner worked under the guise of a kind, caring man of the community. Whilst fooling his family, colleagues and patients he preyed on those who trusted them the most and killed them with an injection of diamorphine. Such a trusted pillar of the community, Shipman, went unquestioned for years killing men and women in the small town of Hyde, in the UK. His cover was eventually blown when he tried to forge one victims will. The true devastation unravelled revealing the doctor to be one of the worlds biggest single serial killers of all time. Shipman never revealed his motive and committed suicide in prison in 2004. This film documents Shipmans horrendous crimes told by the people who were affected by his crimes. Danny Mellors mother was murdered by the GP. Danny and other relatives were shocked. She d been in good health just days before. Lesley Creaseys Auntie was killed by Shipman after a routine visit to her house. She appeared fit and well to neighbours just hours before. Dr Raj Patel worked across the road from Shipman countersigning death certificates for years. His detective work along with his colleagues helped bring the murderer to justice.

In 2000 he was convicted of murdering 215 patients by lethal injection. For over 20 years this general practitioner worked under the guise of a kind, caring man of the community. Whilst fooling his family, colleagues and patients he preyed on those who trusted them the most and killed them with an injection of diamorphine. Such a trusted pillar of the community, Shipman, went unquestioned for years killing men and women in the small town of Hyde, in the UK. His cover was eventually blown when he tried to forge one victims will. The true devastation unravelled revealing the doctor to be one of the worlds biggest single serial killers of all time.

He chose to undergo surgery to straighten out the bend but had to accept that he would lose some of the length. Now that hes lost the length he has excess skin on his penis which is causing him problems when going to the toilet so tonight he undergoes more surgery on his penis to reduce his foreskin. We-ll find out if his problem has been straightened out for good. Dr Christian catches up with Emily, a young girl who was suffering for years with a bowel problem and since the programme has been given a diagnosis which means she-ll have to change her diet for the rest of her life. We also revisit Caroline who came to the clinic with alopecia, and after trying out various treatments has found a surprising solution to her problem, and we revisit David whose cracked hands were getting in the way of his work as a chef. Dr Dawn catches up with Sarah who has been undergoing continuous treatment on a large birthmark and we also follow Faye, one of the first ever embarrassing bodies patients, who came to the clinic with excessive sweating and was given botox, but now the botox has worn off tonight she will undergo a new type of treatment which could put an end to her problem or good.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.21.</episode-num></programme>
