Miami, once a modest, coastal, melting-pot city, was transformed almost overnight into a glitzy metropolis when it became the main point of entry for cocaine into the USA. Chronicling the drug influx of the 1970s and 80s and the resulting gang wars and violence, this is an eye-opening profile of the Miami underworld. Featuring candid interviews with key figures on both sides of the law, it paints a picture of a city overrun by drugs and warring gangs. Taking centrestage are ex-drug dealers/smugglers Jon Roberts and Mickey Munday, who lay out the structure behind the production, import and sale of cocaine, as well as providing their own reminiscences on the excessive heyday of Miamis vice. When the drug business boomed - Miami banks almost ran out of space to store cash deposits - violence inevitably followed.

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.22.</episode-num></programme>

Ask any detective - they will tell you that if they dont have a lead, a suspect or an arrest within 48 hours, their chances of solving the case are cut in half. In a visual style that feels more like a TV drama than a verite reality show, this program follows homicide detectives during these initial critical hours as they race against time to solve their cases. The program follows various detectives of a few select homicide teams as they track breaking cases - each with a running clock that builds pace as the 48 hours inexorably expires.

Ask any detective - they will tell you that if they dont have a lead, a suspect or an arrest within 48 hours, their chances of solving the case are cut in half. In a visual style that feels more like a TV drama than a verite reality show, this program follows homicide detectives during these initial critical hours as they race against time to solve their cases. The program follows various detectives of a few select homicide teams as they track breaking cases - each with a running clock that builds pace as the 48 hours inexorably expires. In this episode, when a young man is shot to death at a motel party, Tulsa detective Justin Ritter discovers a photo posted on Facebook may have triggered a dangerous chain of events.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">18.11.</episode-num></programme>

It may have surrounded an early Welsh chapel, a Roman Fort, a fortified cattle enclosure, or even the ancestral home of one of Waless most important families: the Pritchards. A big empty field with a manor house in it is what geophysics was invented for, but what should be a straightforward search quickly becomes one of the most baffling and frustrating investigations Time Team have undertaken for a long time. As the three-day limit approaches, the digging becomes more and more frantic as fields and gardens are overturned by the diggers trying to get to grips with the missing manor. Even if very little is as it seems, they do discover that the history of the site goes back thousands of years earlier than they expected.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.8.</episode-num></programme>

An ancient moat has been discovered in the next field, and no-one knows what it once protected. It may have surrounded an early Welsh chapel, a Roman Fort, a fortified cattle enclosure, or even the ancestral home of one of Waless most important families: the Pritchards. A big empty field with a manor house in it is what geophysics was invented for, but what should be a straightforward search quickly becomes one of the most baffling and frustrating investigations Time Team have undertaken for a long time. As the three-day limit approaches, the digging becomes more and more frantic as fields and gardens are overturned by the diggers trying to get to grips with the missing manor. Even if very little is as it seems, they do discover that the history of the site goes back thousands of years earlier than they expected.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.8.</episode-num></programme>

But as Stephanie began to look into its history, she realised that there may have been a flour mill on the site since Domesday! So she called in Tony Robinson and his sceptical team of archaeologists to help her unravel the mystery of their accidental mill. For Professor Mick Aston the prospect was too good to turn down.
