However, if this continues as the business grows, that leader will find themselves feeling tired, lonely and without hope. Peter talks with Kent Medwin about the idea of servant leadership - where a leader is proactively working to empower the success of the team as it grows. Kent shares how without this approach, where instead the leader holds onto making all decisions, they become a significant barrier to success. Peter and the team unpack the value that decentralised decision making creates a culture of empowerment and whilst it can be slow to get started, slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.9.</episode-num></programme>

Meanwhile, Tim and James go head-to-head in the kitchen with a summer veg showdown. Colin Hill has swum the English Channel, the Bosphorus and the Hellespont, and he puts pay to any suspicion that a meat-free diet lacks power. But his pasta-heavy diet lacks imagination - pasta and ketchup, anyone? So Hugh whips up some delicious carb-loading dishes that provide plenty of flavour as well as energy. Hugh also makes a campfire lunch for a team working with heavy horses to clear a forest.

Presenter Guy Grossi visits the fennel growing Mason family on the fertile plains outside Melbourne and Amedeo Mason explains just how versatile the winter vegetable can be. Mildura chef Stefano Di Pieri from Stefanos restaurant, who helped to put the area on the culinary map, then shows Guy how he uses the best blood oranges and fennel in season to make a kingfish carpaccio with shaved fennel, a dish that sings with freshness and flavour. In Adelaide, one of the Central Markets favourite characters, butcher Tony Marino, invites us to join his family to cook up an exceptional Abruzzese banquet including the classic porchetta on a spit and the most unusual way of serving polenta - spread on a laminex table and served with a rich ragu.

Despite suffering nine gunshot wounds, one worker survived and was able to identify his assailant. But the case went unsolved until a random bar fight inspired police to dust off the case file. Within days, a teenager named Ruben Cantu was picked up at his high school and arrested for capital murder. Ruben was quickly convicted and sentenced to death. From death row, the barely literate teen wrote an impassioned letter to the city of San Antonio, explaining how hed been framed by police. Investigative reporter Lise Olsen caught wind of the story and began uncovering startling evidence of corruption that led to an official re-investigation of the case.

After Andys father passed away in 2001, Andys mother, Louise, asked Andy to come live with her. Reselling scrap junk became very hard as the market for scrap metal pays much less and so Andy had talked his mother into getting a reverse mortgage on the property which has led to debt due to interest and fees. If the mortgage company came for an inspection, they could determine an unresolvable fault in payment and then take the house from Andy and his mother, leaving them homeless. Now with the help of the Hoarders team of experts, Andy will clean up the property or lose everything.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">13.5.</episode-num></programme>

Beck and Watts gagged the innocent, terrified child. Watts then raped and bashed her. He then callously, and without remorse, cut her throat while his cowardly wife and mother of six watched on. Six days later, a fruit picker discovered Sians mutilated body, still dressed in her Year Seven Sunshine Beach School uniform, in a creek bed. The hunt for the killers and their arrest was led by Bob Atkinson, now Queenslands police commissioner. As a result of thorough and dedicated police work by Queensland detectives, and in concert with New South Wales police, Beck and Watts were located hiding in a motel at Long Jetty on the NSW Central Coast a few weeks later.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.4.</episode-num></programme>
