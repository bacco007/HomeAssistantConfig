The before and after reveals of his work are always highlights, in part because of the history nuggets Rick Dale shares about each object, whether its a barber chair or a gas pump. In this spinoff series, featuring the dynamic characters at Ricks workplace, viewers will watch a variety of objects be bought, bartered and transformed, learning the process of restoration; how do you duplicate Coke machine red? Where can you find 1920s tires? A storyteller who works with tools instead of a pen, Rick shares when and why objects were invented, who used them and how fixing or transforming them changes their value.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.15.</episode-num></programme>

Its normal to experience trauma symptoms immediately after an event and for up to 4 weeks, while the brain is processing it. When people suffer the effects of trauma for much longer, this is known as post traumatic stress disorder and this disruption interferes with an individuals ability to function normally. However, overcoming the effects of trauma and ptsd is possible through treatment which focuses on processing the trauma experiences into memories and restoring a sense of safety both cognitively and emotionally.

Fast food and Hugh do not traditionally go hand-in-hand. There is one exception, however, the findus crispy pancake. By resurrecting their favourite flavours Hugh and River Cottage chef Gill Mellow takes a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Hugh travels to Cornwall to join a group of fisherman who have found a sustainable and lucrative market in line caught squid fishing. After an early morning at sea, Hugh cooks the men deep fried salt and pepper squid with a sweet chilli dipping sauce before the rest of their catch travels to Londons sushi restaurants. Hughs campaign to get more rabbits back in the culinary food chain is picked up and championed by chef Tim Maddams. His first task is to persuade his local curry house not only to experiment with spicy rabbits, but to confidently stick them on their menu. The Landshare campaign, which matches landowners who have land to spare with would-be growers, continues to capture the imagination of the nation. Hugh visits a community who have benefited from the match and are determined to continue to grow and rear their own produce. Chilli and pumpkin night arrives and Hugh has squashes to pickle, chillies to roast and pumpkins to mash in the frenzied run up to this fiery evening.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>

He follows the production of pocket-sprung mattresses from the arrival of hard steel right through to soft bedding heading out of dispatch. Along the way he learns how lengths of metal are stretched into thin wire and coiled into springs which are placed into individual pockets. And how the mattresses are designed to wick sweat away from our bodies with the help of natural fibres like hemp and wool. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is learning whether there are benefits to be had from taking an afternoon nap. She meets up with a sleep scientist who tells her that we should be making time for a snooze rather than reaching for a cup of coffee. To prove his point, he runs an experiment which demonstrates that reaction times can be improved by a short sleep. 20 minutes is the optimum nap time - any longer risks falling in to a deep sleep which is difficult to wake from.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.3.</episode-num></programme>

Fast food and Hugh do not traditionally go hand-in-hand. There is one exception, however, the findus crispy pancake. By resurrecting their favourite flavours Hugh and River Cottage chef Gill Mellow takes a nostalgic trip down memory lane. Hugh travels to Cornwall to join a group of fisherman who have found a sustainable and lucrative market in line caught squid fishing. After an early morning at sea, Hugh cooks the men deep fried salt and pepper squid with a sweet chilli dipping sauce before the rest of their catch travels to Londons sushi restaurants. Hughs campaign to get more rabbits back in the culinary food chain is picked up and championed by chef Tim Maddams. His first task is to persuade his local curry house not only to experiment with spicy rabbits, but to confidently stick them on their menu. The Landshare campaign, which matches landowners who have land to spare with would-be growers, continues to capture the imagination of the nation. Hugh visits a community who have benefited from the match and are determined to continue to grow and rear their own produce. Chilli and pumpkin night arrives and Hugh has squashes to pickle, chillies to roast and pumpkins to mash in the frenzied run up to this fiery evening.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>

He follows the production of pocket-sprung mattresses from the arrival of hard steel right through to soft bedding heading out of dispatch. Along the way he learns how lengths of metal are stretched into thin wire and coiled into springs which are placed into individual pockets. And how the mattresses are designed to wick sweat away from our bodies with the help of natural fibres like hemp and wool. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is learning whether there are benefits to be had from taking an afternoon nap. She meets up with a sleep scientist who tells her that we should be making time for a snooze rather than reaching for a cup of coffee. To prove his point, he runs an experiment which demonstrates that reaction times can be improved by a short sleep. 20 minutes is the optimum nap time - any longer risks falling in to a deep sleep which is difficult to wake from.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.3.</episode-num></programme>

Its the last week of Heats on MasterChef: The Professionals and four new and ambitious chefs set out to prove they have what it takes to win the coveted title. In order to progress in the competition, they must impress in two tests: first the daunting Skills Test, and then, cook two dishes of their own creation in the Signature Menu round. Only the chefs who can demonstrate they could have the all-round skills, technique and flair of a future champion will make it through to the Quarter Final. To kick off, the first two chefs are set a Skills Test by Marcus, who asks them to fillet a sea bream, steam one portion and serve it with an Asian style broth and rice.

Success in her personal life, however, would be much harder to achieve. A well-publicized romance and break-up with Justin Timberlake, a three-day marriage to a childhood sweetheart, and an ill-fated marriage to back-up dancer Kevin Federline made for a chaotic contrast to her record-setting music career.</desc></programme>
