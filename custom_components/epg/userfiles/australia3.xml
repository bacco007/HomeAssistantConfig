In a succession of six laugh out loud games, the team don the usual crazy hats, masks and wigs to ask Questions on the beach, then after another anarchic round of Props, Ryan and Colin construct a Wizard of Oz scene between Dorothy and the Tin Man using audience supplied words in Whose Line. This is followed by a fast moving round of Scenes from a Hat featuring unlikely perfume scents, over caffeinated TV shows and things that dont sound right in an angry voice. After a raucous round of Party Quirks where Greg attempts to guess Waynes celebrities being sucked into a black hole, Colins underwear surveyor and Ryans hungry hummingbird, the show ends with a moving Doo Wop paying tribute to Sarah and her fatal vacuuming accident.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.2.</episode-num></programme>

However, as we dig a little deeper and reflect on history, we see that its not always the person who shouts the loudest, with the highest credentials or even the most wealth that makes the greatest impact. In this short 30-minute program, with the help of Australian and international speakers we will explore what it means to live a life of significance. Our guests have diverse backgrounds, and include politicians, journalists, authors and pastors. Join us as each of them share stories about their own unique personal discovery of significance.

The four remaining teams must summon everything theyve got to make it through to the final of this tantalizingly tough patisserie competition. For their first challenge the teams must create 4 different types of petit fours, including 2 batches which are vegan. The judges will be tougher than ever and expect that each and every one of these bitesize morsels must tantalise their discerning tastebuds. For their second challenge, the teams have 5 hours to become elaborate story tellers as they create an edible table scene inspired by the theme A Teddy Bears Picnic. At the heart of their scene must be jelly based desserts to serve 40 and accompanying edible elements to help bring their story to life. At the end of the challenge, the teams will have to walk the judges through their story with a sense of wonder and as if by magic, reveal their hidden desserts under the tough gaze of judges Benoit and Cherish. By the end of the episode the three finalist teams will have been selected and the team that ranks the lowest will be going home.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.8.</episode-num></programme>

They all have different work shifts, and as Roo is a Coeliac and Ben is a vegetarian, they shop separately and rarely cook or eat together, often getting takeaways and ready meals. Gregg and Chris watch as they each individually do a shop in their local convenience store and its not the shop they were expecting from cashtrapped students. Separate shops mean that they are doubling up and missing out on deals, and branded products and expensive wine mean that with takeaways, these students are spending around 300 pounds a week on food.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.4.</episode-num></programme>

So when electrician and stay-at-home dad Tom and his doctor wife Zewlan decided to build their new home in Ocean Shores, size was everything. Their plan is for a solar passive family home with three modest bedrooms that maximise potential views; small, beautiful spaces on a firm budget of $350,000. With the help of award-winning architects Melanie and James, theyve come up with a design based on the three Ss: small, simple and straightforward. Built out of chipboard, the house will be just half the size of the average Australian home. In a simple layout, three modest bedrooms will connect to one long outside/inside corridor running the length of the house and open underneath, like a deck. The lounge, kitchen and mezzanine will all be easily closed off with huge sliding glass. Toms biggest concern is for the finishes after the exposed chipboard is damaged by some wet weather, hes keen to get the roof on. Will financial pressure and some inclement weather force a re-think or will he and Zewlan stay true to their small house philosophy?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.5.</episode-num></programme>

But 200 years ago Derwentcote was at the heart of an iron- and steel-producing complex that fuelled the spread of empire. Over three days the team fights through the undergrowth to reveal the furnaces and forges that produced the raw materials of industry under appalling conditions. As well as their chainsaws and mechanical diggers, the archaeologists draw on an unusual resource: the memoirs of an 18th-century industrial spy who visited the site. And with the help of old records, they can even put names and trades to the people who occupied the workers cottages that once stood alongside the works. Its a story of how cottage industry gave way to the might of the industrial cities such as Sheffield, and the team uncovers the highs and lows of the working life of Derwentcote. On top of all that, Tony discovers how excited grown men can be when they get to analyse huge lumps of 200-year-old slag.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.4.</episode-num></programme>

But 200 years ago Derwentcote was at the heart of an iron- and steel-producing complex that fuelled the spread of empire. Over three days the team fights through the undergrowth to reveal the furnaces and forges that produced the raw materials of industry under appalling conditions. As well as their chainsaws and mechanical diggers, the archaeologists draw on an unusual resource: the memoirs of an 18th-century industrial spy who visited the site. And with the help of old records, they can even put names and trades to the people who occupied the workers cottages that once stood alongside the works. Its a story of how cottage industry gave way to the might of the industrial cities such as Sheffield, and the team uncovers the highs and lows of the working life of Derwentcote. On top of all that, Tony discovers how excited grown men can be when they get to analyse huge lumps of 200-year-old slag.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">17.4.</episode-num></programme>
