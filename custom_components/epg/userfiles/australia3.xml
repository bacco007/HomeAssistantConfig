Directed by Garret Price (Love, Antosha), the film tells the story of Woodstock99, a music festival promoted to echo unity and counterculture idealism of the original 1969 concert, but instead devolved into riots, looting, and sexual assaults. Unfolding over three days of intense heat and non-stop performances, Woodstock 99: Peace, Love, and Rage examines how the festival eventually collapsed under the weight of its own misguided ambition and resulted in a grim outcome, earning the event the infamous distinction of the day the nineties died. The documentary focuses a spotlight on American youth at the end of the millennium, in the shadow of Columbine and the looming hysteria of Y2K, pinpointing a moment in time when the angst of a generation galvanized into a seism.</desc></programme>

Unfolding over three days of intense heat and non-stop performances, Woodstock 99: Peace, Love, and Rage examines how the festival eventually collapsed under the weight of its own misguided ambition and resulted in a grim outcome, earning the event the infamous distinction of the day the nineties died. The documentary focuses a spotlight on American youth at the end of the millennium, in the shadow of Columbine and the looming hysteria of Y2K, pinpointing a moment in time when the angst of a generation galvanized into a seism.</desc></programme>

ACC.au"><title>PowerPoint with Jack Graham</title><sub-title>What is Faith</sub-title><desc>PowerPoint Ministries started as a vision of Dr Jack Graham and his wife, Deb, 20 years ago. They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.31.</episode-num></programme>

It turns 90 percent of Britains blackcurrants into soft drinks, producing three billion bottles a week. Gregg takes delivery of 500 tonnes of blackcurrants at a cider mill in Somerset. The harvest comes in during July and August when there are no apples to process for cider, so they press blackcurrants instead. Gregg is surprised by the technology they use to press the juice and amazed to discover how the aroma of the blackcurrants is captured separately and later added back into the drink to ensure it has a fully rounded flavour. Next the concentrate and aromas are transported to the drinks factory, where they are mixed with 11 other ingredients before being bottled. Gregg watches a machine that can create a plastic bottle in just 0.1 of a second, and learns why nitrogen is the secret to creating a firm bottle that wont get stuck in vending machines. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is harvesting the berries on a 220ha farm in Kent, one of 40 that supply the factory. Historian Ruth Goodman is investigating the origins of fizzy drinks. Carbonated water was first sold by a certain Mr Schweppe way back in 1783, but it was a British husband and wife team called Robert and Mary White who were to popularise fizzy pop.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.5.</episode-num></programme>
