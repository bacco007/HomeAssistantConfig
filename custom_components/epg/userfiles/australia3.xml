Vera begins to suspect an inside job. But the investigation takes an unexpected turn when Garys ex-wife contacts police with the news that their 13-year-old son is missing. Gary Mallon was acting under duress - the victim of a tiger kidnapping. His son was being held as collateral - but where is he now? In order to rescue the missing boy, Vera first needs to work out who was behind the robbery. Further complications ensue when she finds herself forced to collaborate with an NCA Officer who is working on a covert surveillance operation with links to organised crime.

In this spinoff series, featuring the dynamic characters at Ricks workplace, viewers will watch a variety of objects be bought, bartered and transformed, learning the process of restoration; how do you duplicate Coke machine red? Where can you find 1920s tires?

He lands in the town that placed tequila - and probably Mexico - on the world map and the metropolis that gave us mariachis and dishes like chilli con carne; a city so loved by its people that they insist on repeating its name twice - Guadalajara Guadalajara. But Rick is no stranger to Mexico, and for family holidays he often flies to the tropical beaches of Puerto Vallarta on Mexicos Pacific coast. Nothing matches the view from these picture postcard beaches as waiters create theatre with the famous Mexican flaming coffee, its flames blending with the evening sky as the sun sets over the Pacific. Being a hopeless romantic, Rick cant resist a visit to Casa Kimberly, bought by Richard Burton for Elizabeth Taylor, where they still serve her favourite cocktail - a chocolate martini - as well as Mexicos favourite celebratory dish, chiles en nogada.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.3.</episode-num></programme>

After months of hard fighting the Allies were advancing towards the Rhine and to the east the Russians were closing in on Berlin as part of Operation Bagration. But now Nazi occupied Eastern Europe was giving up its secrets to horrified Allied troops. As they advanced they discovered the nightmare of the concentration camps, where piles of bodies and skeletal people bore testimony to the sheer scale of the Holocaust, the evils of which were almost too much for ordinary soldiers to comprehend. Survivors remember in this episode. By the end of April the Red Army was in Berlin and Hitler was deep in his bunker. He and his new wife Eva Braun committed suicide on April 30th. Just one week later - May 7 - the formal unconditional German surrender came. The following day was declared VE Day in Britain and the "German War" was over. But Japan still fought on.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.10.</episode-num></programme>

After months of hard fighting the Allies were advancing towards the Rhine and to the east the Russians were closing in on Berlin as part of Operation Bagration. But now Nazi occupied Eastern Europe was giving up its secrets to horrified Allied troops. As they advanced they discovered the nightmare of the concentration camps, where piles of bodies and skeletal people bore testimony to the sheer scale of the Holocaust, the evils of which were almost too much for ordinary soldiers to comprehend. Survivors remember in this episode. By the end of April the Red Army was in Berlin and Hitler was deep in his bunker. He and his new wife Eva Braun committed suicide on April 30th. Just one week later - May 7 - the formal unconditional German surrender came. The following day was declared VE Day in Britain and the "German War" was over. But Japan still fought on.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.10.</episode-num></programme>
