This is a challenging task for the employees of Parks Canada, as they have to reconcile tourism and economic interests with nature. And then, of course, there is climate change. Whether and how these developments are putting a strain on sensitive ecosystems will be the main topic of the discovery series, which brings Canadas unique landscape and culture to life.

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more. The Ministry has a vision to glorify God by introducing Jesus Christ as Lord to as many people as possible and to develop them in Christian living using the most effective means to impact the world, making an eternal difference in this generation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.28.</episode-num></programme>

But underneath Simones sweet exterior lies a woman who harbors a dark secret, and is determined to become closer than close to Monica, whether she likes it or not! As time goes on, and Simone becomes more and more enmeshed in Monicas life, Monica starts to pick up on the cracks in Simones shiny facade. As she tries to pull back from Simone, Monica and those around her begin to fear that it may be too late - and even worse, that Simone may have had something to do with the death of her father and collapse of her relationship! Monica decides to sever ties with Simone once and for all, however, Simone has other plans. Will Monica get her life back, or will Simone succeed in taking over Monicas life for good?</desc></programme>

Unexplained burials, identified as deviant and cursed by their contemporaries, were detailed in Stokers original research notes and drafts, discovered by his great-grandson in the family archive. Oxford professor John Blair follows clues in medieval burials in England that may offer insight into physiological reasons for the formation of the myths. The cases hint at a deeply-held belief that the dead could rise and bring fear to the living. A belief that pre-dates the Eastern European lore and is forcing a re-examination of the modern vampire legend.</desc></programme>

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze. Often the blaze stoked such animosities that the fires of intrigue and betrayal never went out.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>

Unexplained burials, identified as deviant and cursed by their contemporaries, were detailed in Stokers original research notes and drafts, discovered by his great-grandson in the family archive. Oxford professor John Blair follows clues in medieval burials in England that may offer insight into physiological reasons for the formation of the myths. The cases hint at a deeply-held belief that the dead could rise and bring fear to the living. A belief that pre-dates the Eastern European lore and is forcing a re-examination of the modern vampire legend.</desc></programme>

But whereas this reality dominated life in the "duck and cover" 1950s, today the threat of nuclear annihilation has largely receded from consciousness. Even as the U.S. and Russia have reduced their stocks of the bomb, the simple black-and-white playing field of the Cold War has been replaced by a complex and unsettled world in which a terrorist with a small nuke in a pickup truck may be a significantly greater threat than the old superpower doomsday scenarios of Fail Safe or Dr. Strangelove. Yet this much is clear: The number of human deaths from war had risen precipitously higher throughout history, until August 1945. From that moment-when the atomic bomb made its appearance on the world stage-the number of deaths from war have dropped enormously. Judged by that measure, the A-bomb may actually have made the world safer so far.</desc></programme>

The Royal Navy planned to ram an old destroyer packed with explosives into the dry dock and detonate after the raiders withdrew.

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze. Often the blaze stoked such animosities that the fires of intrigue and betrayal never went out.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.2.</episode-num></programme>
