Presiding over the UKs most revered cooking competition, are new judge and acclaimed chef Anna Haugh, Michelin-starred chef Marcus Wareing and celebrated MasterChef judge, Gregg Wallace, all eager to discover a brand new culinary star. The Semi Finals continue on MasterChef: The Professionals. Now, only the eight best chefs are left standing and over the next two nights, they are split into two groups as they strive harder than ever to secure an all-important place in Finals Week, moving one step closer to coveted MasterChef: The Professionals title. Tonight, the first four face two challenges and begin with a task outside of the MasterChef kitchen for the first time in the competition. The MasterChef: The Professionals Pop-Up opens its doors in a warehouse micro-brewery in industrial East London. In recent years, pop-up restaurants have revolutionised the way we eat. With a vibrant mix of cuisines on offer in dynamic settings, some of the most exciting food currently in the UK has come from the pop-up industry, enabling creative chefs to make a name for themselves without the cost of opening a traditional restaurant.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">14.13.</episode-num></programme>
