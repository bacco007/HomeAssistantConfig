Everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile.

Assuming the blame for the death of DA Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. Everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. Even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.</desc></programme>

Vera begins to suspect an inside job. But the investigation takes an unexpected turn when Garys ex-wife contacts police with the news that their 13-year-old son is missing. Gary Mallon was acting under duress - the victim of a tiger kidnapping. His son was being held as collateral - but where is he now? In order to rescue the missing boy, Vera first needs to work out who was behind the robbery. Further complications ensue when she finds herself forced to collaborate with an NCA Officer who is working on a covert surveillance operation with links to organised crime. As Vera closes in on the kidnappers a misstep in the investigation leads to tragic repercussions, and she finds herself taken off the case.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">10.2.</episode-num></programme>

Vera begins to suspect an inside job. But the investigation takes an unexpected turn when Garys ex-wife contacts police with the news that their 13-year-old son is missing. Gary Mallon was acting under duress - the victim of a tiger kidnapping. His son was being held as collateral - but where is he now? In order to rescue the missing boy, Vera first needs to work out who was behind the robbery. Further complications ensue when she finds herself forced to collaborate with an NCA Officer who is working on a covert surveillance operation with links to organised crime. As Vera closes in on the kidnappers a misstep in the investigation leads to tragic repercussions, and she finds herself taken off the case.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">10.2.</episode-num></programme>

But many are unfamiliar with the details of her remarkable story, the depth of her character, and the inner motivations that drove her. Born into slavery in Maryland in the 1820s, Harriet Tubmans resolute Christian faith would compel her to extraordinary acts of courage and sacrifice. Through her selfless efforts, hundreds of African-American slaves escaped to freedom. Tubmans tenacious trust in God and love for others earned her the title the Moses of her people. Discover the real Harriet Tubman in this compelling documentary narrated by Alfrelynn Roberts and featuring expert interviews with leading scholars, including Dr Eric Lewis Williams of the Smithsonian Institute and Carl Westmoreland of the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. It also features remarkable early 20th century audio recordings of African-American spirituals sung by former slaves.</desc></programme>

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more.

Weeks later, Richard pronounced himself King. The boys were never seen again. For more than 500 years it has been assumed that Richard killed his nephews in a craven attempt at glory. But, some say, Richard was no child-killing monster. Rather, he was the finest King England ever had. Others say nobody killed the princes at all, and they lived anonymously into old age far away from the cut-throat world of the English court. This film explores what might have happened, interrogating all the possible culprits, and capturing the debates that rage as fiercely as ever. Fresh and incisive, this film combines compelling personal arguments with the latest evidence to present a coherent and contemporary perspective on an enduring mystery.</desc></programme>

Weeks later, Richard pronounced himself King. The boys were never seen again. For more than 500 years it has been assumed that Richard killed his nephews in a craven attempt at glory. But, some say, Richard was no child-killing monster. Rather, he was the finest King England ever had. Others say nobody killed the princes at all, and they lived anonymously into old age far away from the cut-throat world of the English court. This film explores what might have happened, interrogating all the possible culprits, and capturing the debates that rage as fiercely as ever. Fresh and incisive, this film combines compelling personal arguments with the latest evidence to present a coherent and contemporary perspective on an enduring mystery.</desc></programme>
