It is the first full-length feature film project that is told through the eyes of the members of the Bra Boys. It is their story. It shows their success in professional big wave surfing, it explores their international reputation for hard partying and rough justice, it touches on their running battle with authorities and it shows their absolute reliance on one another to fit into a society in which they are displaced and, at times, disinterested. Narrated by Australian actor Russell Crowe, this film looks at the evolution of the suburb of Maroubra, coupled with the historical stigma associated with Australias rebellious surf community. Central to the story is the true-life struggle of the Abberton brothers - Sunny, Koby, Jai and Dakota - one charged with murdering a Sydney standover man, another pursuing a professional surf career but charged as an accessory in his brothers legal fight, another trying to hold the family together and a young brother whose inheritance is his siblings notoriety. The film uses rare archival footage blended with incredible surf vision and intimate interviews to create a story that is both compassionate and exhilarating. Being a Bra Boy is about holding your ground - about brotherhood, honour, loyalty and family, in all its forms. The film is a story of contrast involving against-the-odds success and probable failures and, ultimately, explores the legacy and hopes of this and the next generation of a uniquely Australian community.</desc></programme>

It is the first full-length feature film project that is told through the eyes of the members of the Bra Boys. It is their story. It shows their success in professional big wave surfing, it explores their international reputation for hard partying and rough justice, it touches on their running battle with authorities and it shows their absolute reliance on one another to fit into a society in which they are displaced and, at times, disinterested. Narrated by Australian actor Russell Crowe, this film looks at the evolution of the suburb of Maroubra, coupled with the historical stigma associated with Australias rebellious surf community. Central to the story is the true-life struggle of the Abberton brothers - Sunny, Koby, Jai and Dakota - one charged with murdering a Sydney standover man, another pursuing a professional surf career but charged as an accessory in his brothers legal fight, another trying to hold the family together and a young brother whose inheritance is his siblings notoriety. The film uses rare archival footage blended with incredible surf vision and intimate interviews to create a story that is both compassionate and exhilarating. Being a Bra Boy is about holding your ground - about brotherhood, honour, loyalty and family, in all its forms. The film is a story of contrast involving against-the-odds success and probable failures and, ultimately, explores the legacy and hopes of this and the next generation of a uniquely Australian community.</desc></programme>

Cocaine Cowboys 2: Hustlin with the Godmother picks up where the rip-roaring original leaves off. The story of greed, drugs, sex and crime has been transported from the cocaine-coated streets of 80s Miami to 90s Oakland, where crack is the new drug of choice. Drug baroness Griselda Blanco-whose name is attached to over 250 murders-is behind bars, but thanks to her devoted toy boy Charles Cosby, her business still thrives. But when the Black Widows paranoia worsens, it seems that Cosby is destined to become yet another notch in her murderous belt. Fast-paced, gritty and terrifyingly real, this special takes us into the sleazy, cash-fuelled world of drug front-runners, and introduces us to the woman who made even the most hard-edged criminals cower.</desc></programme>

Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more.

In The Listening Road, youll ride along on one mans remarkable 33-day journey cycling 3,000 miles across the United States on a mission to engage with people from all walks of life in real conversations about things that matter most. As a pastor, Neil Tomba noticed a disturbing trend among people in church: they were finding it increasingly difficult to talk about God to those outside of the church. Neil wanted to practice what he preached, so he set out to bike across the United States, talking - and, more importantly, listening - to strangers from all walks of life about faith, their stories, and matters of the heart. The Listening Road takes you on Neils remarkable journey across the country and straight into its soul - from Route 66 motels to state parks, a lake house, and a railway car; from conversations with Amish farmers to chats with truckers, cowboys, mechanics, and a descendant of Daniel Boone. From one city, farm, and highway to the next, Neil models with compassion and curiosity that genuine connection happens only if we are willing to listen in love.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">.6.</episode-num></programme>

There, movie icons of old like Charlie Chaplin enjoyed eating lambs kidney with bacon alongside the perfect martini on Hollywood Boulevard, and where the A-listers of today opt instead for chopped salad off the avenues of Beverly Hills. On the edge of Downtown LA, Rick discovers Olvera Street, where the Hispanic origins of the city took root. Then onwards, south to San Diego, where he meets 79-year-old Peter Halmay, the oldest sea urchin diver in town, and where a local fishmonger cooks him the best fish chilli he has ever had.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>

Theyre building a stylish beach shack to retire in, one that floats on a pair of untouched sand dunes in Aldinga on Adelaides southern coast. Solar-powered, and aesthetically pleasing, it should be the perfect fit, but Robyn is yet to be convinced. Her life is entrenched in the city so she needs some cajoling. The contemporary modest design features a pair of steel clad pods joined by a timber walkway, and surrounded by native bush. But as soon as building gets under way, the excavation impacts on the environment. Despite their best efforts replanting and shoring up the dunes, the beach scrub soon dwindles and Robyn and Barry are left pondering their next course of action. As the dunes progressively erode, the more Robyn and Barry persevere. But when their self-rusting steel cladding is battered by harsh coastal conditions, staining their deck and turning the exterior into something resembling dribbled fat, Robyns doubts really set in. Can they restore their precious landscape and will Robyn eventually sever her ties with the city and make her project in the dunes home?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.6.</episode-num></programme>

In the Adelaide Hills, its shaped entire towns through stone buildings, many of which were built by the first wave of German immigrants. It was this heritage that drew a couple with Italian blood - web designer Louise Sergie and psychologist husband Steve Hardwick and their three kids - to this pocket of history. They bought a block with stone outhouses and an established English garden, a mix of styles that influences their thinking about their own grand design. Being an owner/builder is stressful for the most experienced, but more so if youre new to the game. The couple are passionate about creating a stone home and want to blend a Tuscan feel with a modern look, using 160 tonnes of locally quarried stone to create castle-thick walls, recycled timbers for internal joinery, and a cutting-edge bridge linking the upstairs rooms with a dynamic glass box, will ensure that this will be a style that defies categorisation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.7.</episode-num></programme>

Lenny was born in the inner-Sydney suburb of Balmain in 1921, the 10th child of metalworker William McPherson and his wife, Nellie. He had some schooling at Birchgrove Primary School, and his first brush with the law came at the age of 11 when he was convicted of stealing. Eighteen months later he was convicted on two charges of stealing and sent to a detention centre, where he was bashed and raped. He went on to a life of serious crime and was universally feared by his adversaries and often referred to as Sydneys Mr Big of organised crime, protected by police who relied on his information to control the Sydney underworld. McPherson had been estranged from his mother for many years, but on her 70th birthday, he unexpectedly turned up at her flat, carrying a live rabbit. He demanded to know why he had not been invited to her birthday party, and when she admitted that it was because of his criminal activities, the furious McPherson tore the rabbits head off, threw the still-twitching body at her feet and stormed off. He died of a heart attack in Cessnock Gaol in 1996, aged 75. George Freeman was king of Sydneys SP bookies and was involved with McPherson in massive money laundering operations on Sydney race tracks and the corruption of Sydney chief magistrate Murray Farquar. During the 1970s, George Freeman was shot with a .22 pistol but survived, and, less than six weeks later, the man suspected of the shooting was himself shot dead in the driveway of his Coogee home.

Lenny was born in the inner-Sydney suburb of Balmain in 1921, the 10th child of metalworker William McPherson and his wife, Nellie. He had some schooling at Birchgrove Primary School, and his first brush with the law came at the age of 11 when he was convicted of stealing. Eighteen months later he was convicted on two charges of stealing and sent to a detention centre, where he was bashed and raped. He went on to a life of serious crime and was universally feared by his adversaries and often referred to as Sydneys Mr Big of organised crime, protected by police who relied on his information to control the Sydney underworld. McPherson had been estranged from his mother for many years, but on her 70th birthday, he unexpectedly turned up at her flat, carrying a live rabbit. He demanded to know why he had not been invited to her birthday party, and when she admitted that it was because of his criminal activities, the furious McPherson tore the rabbits head off, threw the still-twitching body at her feet and stormed off. He died of a heart attack in Cessnock Gaol in 1996, aged 75. George Freeman was king of Sydneys SP bookies and was involved with McPherson in massive money laundering operations on Sydney race tracks and the corruption of Sydney chief magistrate Murray Farquar. During the 1970s, George Freeman was shot with a .22 pistol but survived, and, less than six weeks later, the man suspected of the shooting was himself shot dead in the driveway of his Coogee home. Freeman, who was holidaying in Noosa at the time, refused to answer questions on the matter.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.6.</episode-num></programme>

Lenny was born in the inner-Sydney suburb of Balmain in 1921, the 10th child of metalworker William McPherson and his wife, Nellie. He had some schooling at Birchgrove Primary School, and his first brush with the law came at the age of 11 when he was convicted of stealing. Eighteen months later he was convicted on two charges of stealing and sent to a detention centre, where he was bashed and raped.

When his DNA matched semen at the crime scene, he couldnt believe it, neither could Kens parents, girlfriend, and even the victims mother.

Even the biggest tank battle in history -at Kursk - could not stem the Russian tide.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.8.</episode-num></programme>
