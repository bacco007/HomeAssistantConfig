He was joined by The Merry Band of Pranksters, a renegade group of counterculture truth-seekers, including Neal Cassady, the American icon immortalised in Kerouacs On the Road. Kesey and the Pranksters intended to make a documentary about their trip, shooting hours of 16mm footage, but the film was never finished and the footage has remained virtually unseen ... until now. Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney and Alison Ellwood were given unprecedented access to this raw footage by the Kesey family.

ACC.au"><title>PowerPoint with Jack Graham</title><sub-title>Dark Angel</sub-title><desc>PowerPoint Ministries started as a vision of Dr Jack Graham and his wife, Deb, 20 years ago. They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more.

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder. Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels. In a world exclusive, the program also includes footage as the police entered the vault for the first time.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

Believing sex is the motive and that the victim knew her killers, investigators immediately zero in on two prime suspects: Merediths 20-year-old American roommate, Amanda Knox, and her handsome Italian boyfriend. But a few weeks later, forensic evidence suggests someone else was also at the house that night. Can investigators determine who is telling the truth?

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder. Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels. In a world exclusive, the program also includes footage as the police entered the vault for the first time.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder. Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels. In a world exclusive, the program also includes footage as the police entered the vault for the first time.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

Believing sex is the motive and that the victim knew her killers, investigators immediately zero in on two prime suspects: Merediths 20-year-old American roommate, Amanda Knox, and her handsome Italian boyfriend. But a few weeks later, forensic evidence suggests someone else was also at the house that night. Can investigators determine who is telling the truth?

He became so close to Hitler and the running of the war that Hitler once screamed To win this war, I need Bormann! More sinister was Bormanns involvement in ensuring the progress of the final solution. Himmler had to report to Bormann on the extermination of the Jews. Bormann, Hitlers doctor Stumpfegger and Artur Axmann (the Head of the Hitler Youth) all left the bunker in Berlin together after Hitlers suicide on 30th April 1945.

More sinister was Bormanns involvement in ensuring the progress of the final solution. Himmler had to report to Bormann on the extermination of the Jews. Bormann, Hitlers doctor Stumpfegger and Artur Axmann (the Head of the Hitler Youth) all left the bunker in Berlin together after Hitlers suicide on 30th April 1945.

The trouble was, militarily he was a disaster. After failed attacks in North Africa and Greece, his armies were on the run. Hitler now faced a difficult choice. Did he divert troops needed at other fronts to support his ally, or did he let Mussolini fall? Hitler chose to support him - a decision that would spell disaster for both of them. Hilter would lose hundreds of thousands of troops. Mussolini would lose his life. This film tells the extraordinary story of the war in North Africa and features the heroics of the tiny island called Malta as it withstood wave after wave of Nazi assault. It ends with the Allies fighting their way up Italy and Germany in retreat.

Bormann made Hitler and the Third Reich rich through thinly veiled extortion schemes such as The Hitler Endowment Fund of German Industry. He also came up with the idea of charging royalties on Hitlers image on postage stamps - and so made his Fuhrer personally wealthy. He became so close to Hitler and the running of the war that Hitler once screamed To win this war, I need Bormann! More sinister was Bormanns involvement in ensuring the progress of the final solution. Himmler had to report to Bormann on the extermination of the Jews. Bormann, Hitlers doctor Stumpfegger and Artur Axmann (the Head of the Hitler Youth) all left the bunker in Berlin together after Hitlers suicide on 30th April 1945. After Axmann left them at the Lehrter Station Bormann and Stumpfegger disappeared.

The trouble was, militarily he was a disaster. After failed attacks in North Africa and Greece, his armies were on the run. Hitler now faced a difficult choice. Did he divert troops needed at other fronts to support his ally, or did he let Mussolini fall? Hitler chose to support him - a decision that would spell disaster for both of them. Hilter would lose hundreds of thousands of troops. Mussolini would lose his life. This film tells the extraordinary story of the war in North Africa and features the heroics of the tiny island called Malta as it withstood wave after wave of Nazi assault. It ends with the Allies fighting their way up Italy and Germany in retreat. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed, particularly in the last five to 10 years as documents, files and photographs have been released.
