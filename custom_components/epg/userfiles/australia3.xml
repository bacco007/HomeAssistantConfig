In the last decade, with the establishment of the Internet, the image has once again traveled the globe in many forms. From protest to commerce, it is constantly transformed and reinvented. It is considered to be the most reproduced image in the history of photography. Why and how did this photograph become so important? This is a film about a photograph.

History conspired to enable this dynamic portrait to explode on the world scene in 1968 throughout Europe and Latin America, when it became an international symbol of protest and dissent. In the last decade, with the establishment of the Internet, the image has once again traveled the globe in many forms. From protest to commerce, it is constantly transformed and reinvented. It is considered to be the most reproduced image in the history of photography. Why and how did this photograph become so important? This is a film about a photograph.

Thanks to David Maisel and Arad, Marvel had the funding in place to produce their own films.

But Pauls wealthy parents forbid him to associate with a poor Landry while Grandmere urges her to follow her dream of becoming a great painter. In a faded photograph, Ruby glimpses for the first time the image of her father and learns of a shameful deception and a shocking scheme of blackmail that now must come to light. Stunned by these revelations, she is devastated when Grandmere dies, leaving her to seek out her father in his vast New Orleans mansion. There, in a house of lies, madness, and cruel torment, Ruby clings to her memories of Paul to keep her heart alive. For only their love can save her now.</desc></programme>
