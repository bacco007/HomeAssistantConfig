Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more.

With her throat slashed, Meredith Kerchers half-naked body is found in her locked bedroom.

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder. Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels. In a world exclusive, the program also includes footage as the police entered the vault for the first time.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

A voodoo priestess, a stripper, and an ex-con make the list of possible suspects. When the investigation stalls, the victims family hires their own private investigator.

A PhD student at the time, Griffiths was working on his doctoral thesis regarding applied criminal justice. He was charged with murdering 43-year-old Susan Rushworth, 31-year-old Shelley Armitage and 36-year-old Suzanne Blamires. Four days after Ms Blamires vanished, he was arrested. Griffiths hid a dark side from the world. He was obsessed with murder and serial killers. He had a misogynistic, vicious and violent streak, enjoying what he saw as some sort of power over prostitutes. On May 24, 2010, a caretaker at Griffiths block of flats was checking CCTV from the weekend before. What he saw was shocking. A woman could be seen running from Griffiths flat, terrified, screaming. Seconds later, he was chasing her before going out of shot. Knocking her unconscious, Griffiths dragged her back in front of the camera before firing a bolt through her head. This was Suzanne Blamires. He then deposited her body in the nearby River Aire, where officers found it the day after arresting Griffiths. Human remains were also found of Shelley Armitage, but Susan Rushworths body was never discovered. The program interviews the victims families along with those who knew Griffiths to gain some kind of insight into the man who calls himself the Crossbow Cannibal.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

A PhD student at the time, Griffiths was working on his doctoral thesis regarding applied criminal justice. He was charged with murdering 43-year-old Susan Rushworth, 31-year-old Shelley Armitage and 36-year-old Suzanne Blamires. Four days after Ms Blamires vanished, he was arrested. Griffiths hid a dark side from the world. He was obsessed with murder and serial killers. He had a misogynistic, vicious and violent streak, enjoying what he saw as some sort of power over prostitutes. On May 24, 2010, a caretaker at Griffiths block of flats was checking CCTV from the weekend before. What he saw was shocking. A woman could be seen running from Griffiths flat, terrified, screaming. Seconds later, he was chasing her before going out of shot. Knocking her unconscious, Griffiths dragged her back in front of the camera before firing a bolt through her head. This was Suzanne Blamires. He then deposited her body in the nearby River Aire, where officers found it the day after arresting Griffiths. Human remains were also found of Shelley Armitage, but Susan Rushworths body was never discovered. The program interviews the victims families along with those who knew Griffiths to gain some kind of insight into the man who calls himself the Crossbow Cannibal.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

Shot twice in the head before being set ablaze, the victim is David Stevens, an amateur bodybuilder and Nebraska native. But just who would want to kill the man described by friends as a naive and easygoing "good ole boy"? The only clue for investigators, Stevens unkempt bed, reveals he had sex with a mystery woman hours before he was murdered. A voodoo priestess, a stripper, and an ex-con make the list of possible suspects. When the investigation stalls, the victims family hires their own private investigator. After a series of false leads, the bizarre case eventually goes cold - that is, until a woman makes a sensational confession, and a sordid tale of jealousy, sex, and cold-blooded murder is finally revealed.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.11.</episode-num></programme>

But the trial that led to the horrific outcome began years earlier, when police began a routine re-investigation of a missing persons case in Adelaide. The more they looked into the case, however, the more missing people they uncovered - and connected to all the missing people were two men: John Bunting and Robert Wagner. As their investigation continued, the trial of missing people led them to a bank vault in Snowtown. Inside the vault, they found several barrels - all containing body parts. The arrest of Bunting, Wagner, plus two associates, Mark Haydon and Jamie Vlassakis, unravelled the whole saga - a saga of torture, sadism and murder. Between August 1992 and May 1999, John Bunting and Robert Wagner tortured and murdered 12 people (many of whom they knew) from Adelaide - stealing their money and forcing them to record messages to loved ones that were used to convince friends and relatives they were still alive. The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels.

The trial that followed was one of the longest and most publicised in Australian legal history. Bunting and Wagner were eventually found guilty and imprisoned, never to be released. This program features an exclusive interview with Paul Schramm who led the investigation, as well as other officers who also worked on the case. We investigate the psychology of John Bunting and meet the man who had the grim task of identifying the bodies in the barrels. In a world exclusive, the program also includes footage as the police entered the vault for the first time.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.0.</episode-num></programme>

A PhD student at the time, Griffiths was working on his doctoral thesis regarding applied criminal justice. He was charged with murdering 43-year-old Susan Rushworth, 31-year-old Shelley Armitage and 36-year-old Suzanne Blamires. Four days after Ms Blamires vanished, he was arrested. Griffiths hid a dark side from the world. He was obsessed with murder and serial killers. He had a misogynistic, vicious and violent streak, enjoying what he saw as some sort of power over prostitutes. On May 24, 2010, a caretaker at Griffiths block of flats was checking CCTV from the weekend before. What he saw was shocking. A woman could be seen running from Griffiths flat, terrified, screaming. Seconds later, he was chasing her before going out of shot. Knocking her unconscious, Griffiths dragged her back in front of the camera before firing a bolt through her head. This was Suzanne Blamires. He then deposited her body in the nearby River Aire, where officers found it the day after arresting Griffiths. Human remains were also found of Shelley Armitage, but Susan Rushworths body was never discovered.

He became so close to Hitler and the running of the war that Hitler once screamed To win this war, I need Bormann! More sinister was Bormanns involvement in ensuring the progress of the final solution. Himmler had to report to Bormann on the extermination of the Jews. Bormann, Hitlers doctor Stumpfegger and Artur Axmann (the Head of the Hitler Youth) all left the bunker in Berlin together after Hitlers suicide on 30th April 1945. After Axmann left them at the Lehrter Station Bormann and Stumpfegger disappeared.

Bormann made Hitler and the Third Reich rich through thinly veiled extortion schemes such as The Hitler Endowment Fund of German Industry. He also came up with the idea of charging royalties on Hitlers image on postage stamps - and so made his Fuhrer personally wealthy. He became so close to Hitler and the running of the war that Hitler once screamed To win this war, I need Bormann! More sinister was Bormanns involvement in ensuring the progress of the final solution. Himmler had to report to Bormann on the extermination of the Jews. Bormann, Hitlers doctor Stumpfegger and Artur Axmann (the Head of the Hitler Youth) all left the bunker in Berlin together after Hitlers suicide on 30th April 1945. After Axmann left them at the Lehrter Station Bormann and Stumpfegger disappeared. This led to one of the longest Nazi hunts in history.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>

Britains Sir Arthur Bomber Harris thought the answer might lie in strategic bombing. The idea was to blow the hell out of Germanys infrastructure and cities. This, he argued, would cripple the Nazis ability to wage a war and the ordinary people would soon lose the will to fight. But it led directly to the tragedy of Dresden, when Allied planes firebombed tens of thousands of ordinary Germans. The Germans believed that the knockout blow would come from their submarines. If they could only cut American supply lines to Britain across the Atlantic, then the Allied effort would collapse. So began a long game of cat-and-mouse between U-boats and British and American convoys. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed, particularly in the last five to 10 years, as documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict.

Local people believe their town should appear on the list of great Roman cities alongside Colchester, Bath and St Albans. Its known more for its rugby than its history, but 2000 years ago, the great Roman highway of Ermine Street went through the centre and a huge fort dominated the town.

Britains Sir Arthur Bomber Harris thought the answer might lie in strategic bombing. The idea was to blow the hell out of Germanys infrastructure and cities. This, he argued, would cripple the Nazis ability to wage a war and the ordinary people would soon lose the will to fight. But it led directly to the tragedy of Dresden, when Allied planes firebombed tens of thousands of ordinary Germans. The Germans believed that the knockout blow would come from their submarines. If they could only cut American supply lines to Britain across the Atlantic, then the Allied effort would collapse. So began a long game of cat-and-mouse between U-boats and British and American convoys. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed, particularly in the last five to 10 years, as documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict. With the very latest satellite-delivered terrain mapping and state-of-the-art graphics, this story can now be told with the very latest access to information which was not previously available.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.6.</episode-num></programme>
