Everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. Even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane.</desc></programme>

History conspired to enable this dynamic portrait to explode on the world scene in 1968 throughout Europe and Latin America, when it became an international symbol of protest and dissent. In the last decade, with the establishment of the Internet, the image has once again traveled the globe in many forms. From protest to commerce, it is constantly transformed and reinvented. It is considered to be the most reproduced image in the history of photography. Why and how did this photograph become so important? This is a film about a photograph. It explores how the Che image traveled from Kordas studio in Havana to the streets of Europe and beyond. We investigate how this portrait with its enigmatic gaze became a symbol for countless visions for change.</desc></programme>

History conspired to enable this dynamic portrait to explode on the world scene in 1968 throughout Europe and Latin America, when it became an international symbol of protest and dissent. In the last decade, with the establishment of the Internet, the image has once again traveled the globe in many forms. From protest to commerce, it is constantly transformed and reinvented. It is considered to be the most reproduced image in the history of photography. Why and how did this photograph become so important? This is a film about a photograph. It explores how the Che image traveled from Kordas studio in Havana to the streets of Europe and beyond.

Although many characters had been licensed to other studios, Feige realized that Marvel still retained rights to the core members of The Avengers. Thanks to David Maisel and Arad, Marvel had the funding in place to produce their own films. If the shared universe that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had created in 1960s comic books could be replicated in movies with state-of-the-art special effects, Feige believed Marvel could become an unstoppable blockbuster generator, starting with Iron Man.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>

Although many characters had been licensed to other studios, Feige realized that Marvel still retained rights to the core members of The Avengers. Thanks to David Maisel and Arad, Marvel had the funding in place to produce their own films. If the shared universe that Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had created in 1960s comic books could be replicated in movies with state-of-the-art special effects, Feige believed Marvel could become an unstoppable blockbuster generator, starting with Iron Man.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.1.</episode-num></programme>

But the thick, expensive walls of Cypress Woods cannot shut out the terrible memories and shocking reasons that have woven their fabric over her destiny, or the cold eyes of Pauls mother, Gladys, reminding Ruby of the secret she must keep to give Pearl a loving father. Desperate to find the complete, fulfilling life she craves, Ruby builds a precarious new existence, a flimsy shanty of hope that the first flood washes away.

The only family Ruby Landry has ever known are her loving guardian, Grandmere Catherine, a Cajun spiritual healer, and her drunken, outcast Grandpere Jack. Her life is filled with hope and promise, especially when her attraction for handsome Paul Tate blossoms into a mysterious, wonderful love. But Pauls wealthy parents forbid him to associate with a poor Landry while Grandmere urges her to follow her dream of becoming a great painter. In a faded photograph, Ruby glimpses for the first time the image of her father and learns of a shameful deception and a shocking scheme of blackmail that now must come to light. Stunned by these revelations, she is devastated when Grandmere dies, leaving her to seek out her father in his vast New Orleans mansion. There, in a house of lies, madness, and cruel torment, Ruby clings to her memories of Paul to keep her heart alive. For only their love can save her now.</desc></programme>

By the age of 21, Britney Spears already had a number one platinum, debut album, a cover on Rolling Stone, a record-breaking second album, and international superstardom. Success in her personal life, however, would be much harder to achieve. A well-publicized romance and break-up with Justin Timberlake, a three-day marriage to a childhood sweetheart, and an ill-fated marriage to back-up dancer Kevin Federline made for a chaotic contrast to her record-setting music career.</desc></programme>

Ask any detective - they will tell you that if they dont have a lead, a suspect or an arrest within 48 hours, their chances of solving the case are cut in half. In a visual style that feels more like a TV drama than a verite reality show, this program follows homicide detectives during these initial critical hours as they race against time to solve their cases. The program follows various detectives of a few select homicide teams as they track breaking cases - each with a running clock that builds pace as the 48 hours inexorably expires.

Ask any detective - they will tell you that if they dont have a lead, a suspect or an arrest within 48 hours, their chances of solving the case are cut in half. In a visual style that feels more like a TV drama than a verite reality show, this program follows homicide detectives during these initial critical hours as they race against time to solve their cases. The program follows various detectives of a few select homicide teams as they track breaking cases - each with a running clock that builds pace as the 48 hours inexorably expires. In this episode, in Atlanta, a brash murder in front of an elementary school turns up a familiar name.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">18.18.</episode-num></programme>
