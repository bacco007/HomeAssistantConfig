Committing to this new purpose brought her initially in conflict with the Catholic Church and the Government of India. Undaunted by the obstacles and challenges of her new calling, she rose to become viewed by many as the greatest humanitarian of modern time. Letters from Mother Teresa tells the story of how this tiny figure of a woman changed hearts, lives and inspired millions. Though she herself grew to feel an isolation and an abandonment by God, she said she saw God in every human being. The movie explores the life of Mother Teresa (Juliet Stevenson) through letters she wrote to her longtime friend and spiritual advisor, Father Celeste van Exem (Max von Sydow) over a nearly fifty-year period.</desc></programme>

In the 18th century a spiritual and cultural revolution swept across Great Britain and her American colonies. The marvel of this revolution was the son of a Tavern keeper. Out of these humble beginnings came a powerful voice proclaiming the new birth being Born Again. Whitefields voice startled the church like a trumpet blast. His theatrical persuasion transformed the pulpit into sacred theatre. He took the church outdoors and preached to tens of thousands at a time from Moorfields in London to Boston Common in the American colonies. He lifted his voice to preach to the spiritually starving masses and ignited the Evangelical Revival and the First Great Awakening. Whitefield was the most famous man of his time. He crossed the Atlantic 13 times, preached 18 thousand sermons to an estimated 10 million people. He brought about massive social, political, and spiritual transformation in the Transatlantic world with his message .</desc></programme>

Because of the more than hasty take-off, one of the visitors is left behind. The little alien finds himself all alone on a very strange planet. Fortunately, the extra-terrestrial soon finds a friend and emotional companion in 10-year-old Elliot, who discovered him looking for food in his familys garden shed. While E.T. slowly gets acquainted with Elliots brother Michael, his sister Gertie as well as with Earth customs, members of the task force work day and night to track down the whereabouts of Earths first visitor from Outer Space.</desc></programme>

But in the shadows lurks another story of drugs, crime, and brutal violence. The two worlds collide on Christmas Eve, 1991, when 23-year-old tourist Dana Ireland takes a bike ride through paradise that ends in tragedy. Hit by a car, raped, and left for dead on a remote trail, Danas murder devastates her family and sends ripples of fear throughout the state. Police investigate a murky world few tourists ever see but come up empty. From the get-go, the police investigation is fraught. The crime scene evidence is messy, forensic technology cant connect the dots, and most suspects or witnesses are either tight-lipped or flat-out lying. When Danas father, furious with the polices lack of results, posts a $28,000 reward for any leads, lowlife tipsters come crawling out of the woodwork and overwhelm police with false information. Lead Detective, Steve Guillermo, is certain of only one fact - a small car struck Danas bike. The search for this vehicle takes over six years but upon finding it, Guillermo starts to untangle the web of lies. Three weeks before a statute of limitations ends on the prime suspects, Guillermo gets a break that closes the case for good.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.0.</episode-num></programme>

But in the shadows lurks another story of drugs, crime, and brutal violence. The two worlds collide on Christmas Eve, 1991, when 23-year-old tourist Dana Ireland takes a bike ride through paradise that ends in tragedy. Hit by a car, raped, and left for dead on a remote trail, Danas murder devastates her family and sends ripples of fear throughout the state. Police investigate a murky world few tourists ever see but come up empty. From the get-go, the police investigation is fraught. The crime scene evidence is messy, forensic technology cant connect the dots, and most suspects or witnesses are either tight-lipped or flat-out lying. When Danas father, furious with the polices lack of results, posts a $28,000 reward for any leads, lowlife tipsters come crawling out of the woodwork and overwhelm police with false information. Lead Detective, Steve Guillermo, is certain of only one fact - a small car struck Danas bike. The search for this vehicle takes over six years but upon finding it, Guillermo starts to untangle the web of lies. Three weeks before a statute of limitations ends on the prime suspects, Guillermo gets a break that closes the case for good.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.0.</episode-num></programme>

The Italian ships, thought to be virtually immune to air attack, were protected by anti-torpedo nets, and surrounded by barrage balloons and anti-aircraft defences. But, in less than two hours, the lumbering Swordfish torpedo bombers were able to sink or disable three battleships and several cruisers, and severely damage port installations.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.12.</episode-num></programme>

But even now, the outcome was in the balance. The film explores the Allied disaster at Arnhem and the tragedy of the Warsaw uprising, when Polish freedom fighters were abandoned to their fate by Stalin. It tells the shocking story of the liberation of the death camps, when the full extent of the Holocaust became clear for the first time. The film ends with Hitlers last great gamble, as he threw all his last reserves against the oncoming Allied forces in the Ardennes. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed particularly in the last five to 10 years, when documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict. With the very latest satellite-delivered terrain mapping and state-of-the-art graphics, this story can now be told with the very latest access to information which was not previously available.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.9.</episode-num></programme>

But even now, the outcome was in the balance. The film explores the Allied disaster at Arnhem and the tragedy of the Warsaw uprising, when Polish freedom fighters were abandoned to their fate by Stalin. It tells the shocking story of the liberation of the death camps, when the full extent of the Holocaust became clear for the first time. The film ends with Hitlers last great gamble, as he threw all his last reserves against the oncoming Allied forces in the Ardennes. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed particularly in the last five to 10 years, when documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict. With the very latest satellite-delivered terrain mapping and state-of-the-art graphics, this story can now be told with the very latest access to information which was not previously available.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.9.</episode-num></programme>
