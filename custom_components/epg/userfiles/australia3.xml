He was joined by The Merry Band of Pranksters, a renegade group of counterculture truth-seekers, including Neal Cassady, the American icon immortalised in Kerouacs On the Road. Kesey and the Pranksters intended to make a documentary about their trip, shooting hours of 16mm footage, but the film was never finished and the footage has remained virtually unseen ... until now. Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney and Alison Ellwood were given unprecedented access to this raw footage by the Kesey family.

They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more.

Maeve visits the inspiring Ricupero family who settled in Jarrahdale outside Perth, where they grow vegetables on a large scale and bake 140 loaves of bread every two weeks in the huge oven they built themselves - the crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside pane di casa so adored by Italians. Guy then shows a recipe for delicious bruschetta, using day-old bread. Guy joins olive oil producer Joe Grilli from Primo Estate in McLaren Vale at harvest time and learns about mixing oils for the perfect blend. Vongole harvester Tony Petruzzelli takes us to work as he rakes waist-deep in water off Adelaides outer harbour, then Sydney chef Eugenio Maiale cooks up the classic spaghetti alla vongole, the one dish that he always keeps on his menu at his popular inner-city restaurant A Tavola. For sweets, the crunchy fried biscuit cannoli filled with fresh ricotta is close to heaven, especially when its made by second-generation Sicilian sweets master Achille Mellini from Grossi Florentino.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.0.</episode-num></programme>

Another fire leaves a 72-year-old woman dead in her mobile home. And days later, a 79-year-old woman is brutally raped before her mobile home is torched.

Even today the images captured on islands such as Iwo Jima and Okinawa - some of which are included here - have the power to shock a world numbed by the horrors of more recent events. The names of the islands are seared into the pages of US history. Here, veterans of the campaign share their memories and experiences of the most pitiless and brutal of fighting. Here too we see and hear about the A Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki - the devastating last acts of a war that had claimed millions of lives. They also ushered in the nuclear age. And finally, we examine the legacy of world historys most destructive, costly conflict.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.11.</episode-num></programme>

At dawn on May 10, 1940, Germany conducted historys first glider-borne assault against Fort Eben Emael. Despite powerful guns and heavy armour, the Belgians neglected to defend the roof where nine flimsy, fabric-covered gliders landed and disgorged 71 paratroopers. Using computer graphics, archive footage, and reconstruction shot in the passageways and tunnels, we examine how the fortress fell so easily.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.5.</episode-num></programme>

In the early morning hours of May 10th, Navy F-4 Phantom pilot Curt Dose and his back-seater Jim McDevitt streak towards North Vietnam with a powerful Alpha strike formation. Their target is the port city of Haiphong. Suddenly, Dose and Hawkins get a radio call bandits. Dose quickly engages a MiG-21. He gets good tone on his Sidewinder missile and fires. Dose watches as the missile makes a final quick adjustment, then buries itself in the MiGs tail pipe. They go full afterburner, screaming out of the area at Mach 1.2. They streak over Kep airfield towards the coast.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.6.</episode-num></programme>

Planned by General Ludendorff, the Kaisers Battle was Germanys last desperate throw of the dice, a final massive effort to turn the tide of the Great War. The thunderous artillery bombardment by more than 6000 guns which opened the offensive was the largest the war had yet seen. A million German troops were committed to the offensive, and the fighting was some of the most bitter and bloody of the war.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.49.</episode-num></programme>
