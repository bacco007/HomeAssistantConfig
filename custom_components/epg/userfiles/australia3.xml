It is the first full-length feature film project that is told through the eyes of the members of the Bra Boys. It is their story. It shows their success in professional big wave surfing, it explores their international reputation for hard partying and rough justice, it touches on their running battle with authorities and it shows their absolute reliance on one another to fit into a society in which they are displaced and, at times, disinterested. Narrated by Australian actor Russell Crowe, this film looks at the evolution of the suburb of Maroubra, coupled with the historical stigma associated with Australias rebellious surf community. Central to the story is the true-life struggle of the Abberton brothers - Sunny, Koby, Jai and Dakota - one charged with murdering a Sydney standover man, another pursuing a professional surf career but charged as an accessory in his brothers legal fight, another trying to hold the family together and a young brother whose inheritance is his siblings notoriety. The film uses rare archival footage blended with incredible surf vision and intimate interviews to create a story that is both compassionate and exhilarating. Being a Bra Boy is about holding your ground - about brotherhood, honour, loyalty and family, in all its forms. The film is a story of contrast involving against-the-odds success and probable failures and, ultimately, explores the legacy and hopes of this and the next generation of a uniquely Australian community.</desc></programme>

It is the first full-length feature film project that is told through the eyes of the members of the Bra Boys. It is their story. It shows their success in professional big wave surfing, it explores their international reputation for hard partying and rough justice, it touches on their running battle with authorities and it shows their absolute reliance on one another to fit into a society in which they are displaced and, at times, disinterested. Narrated by Australian actor Russell Crowe, this film looks at the evolution of the suburb of Maroubra, coupled with the historical stigma associated with Australias rebellious surf community. Central to the story is the true-life struggle of the Abberton brothers - Sunny, Koby, Jai and Dakota - one charged with murdering a Sydney standover man, another pursuing a professional surf career but charged as an accessory in his brothers legal fight, another trying to hold the family together and a young brother whose inheritance is his siblings notoriety. The film uses rare archival footage blended with incredible surf vision and intimate interviews to create a story that is both compassionate and exhilarating. Being a Bra Boy is about holding your ground - about brotherhood, honour, loyalty and family, in all its forms. The film is a story of contrast involving against-the-odds success and probable failures and, ultimately, explores the legacy and hopes of this and the next generation of a uniquely Australian community.</desc></programme>

Lenny was born in the inner-Sydney suburb of Balmain in 1921, the 10th child of metalworker William McPherson and his wife, Nellie. He had some schooling at Birchgrove Primary School, and his first brush with the law came at the age of 11 when he was convicted of stealing. Eighteen months later he was convicted on two charges of stealing and sent to a detention centre, where he was bashed and raped. He went on to a life of serious crime and was universally feared by his adversaries and often referred to as Sydneys Mr Big of organised crime, protected by police who relied on his information to control the Sydney underworld. McPherson had been estranged from his mother for many years, but on her 70th birthday, he unexpectedly turned up at her flat, carrying a live rabbit. He demanded to know why he had not been invited to her birthday party, and when she admitted that it was because of his criminal activities, the furious McPherson tore the rabbits head off, threw the still-twitching body at her feet and stormed off. He died of a heart attack in Cessnock Gaol in 1996, aged 75. George Freeman was king of Sydneys SP bookies and was involved with McPherson in massive money laundering operations on Sydney race tracks and the corruption of Sydney chief magistrate Murray Farquar. During the 1970s, George Freeman was shot with a .22 pistol but survived, and, less than six weeks later, the man suspected of the shooting was himself shot dead in the driveway of his Coogee home.

Lenny was born in the inner-Sydney suburb of Balmain in 1921, the 10th child of metalworker William McPherson and his wife, Nellie. He had some schooling at Birchgrove Primary School, and his first brush with the law came at the age of 11 when he was convicted of stealing. Eighteen months later he was convicted on two charges of stealing and sent to a detention centre, where he was bashed and raped. He went on to a life of serious crime and was universally feared by his adversaries and often referred to as Sydneys Mr Big of organised crime, protected by police who relied on his information to control the Sydney underworld. McPherson had been estranged from his mother for many years, but on her 70th birthday, he unexpectedly turned up at her flat, carrying a live rabbit. He demanded to know why he had not been invited to her birthday party, and when she admitted that it was because of his criminal activities, the furious McPherson tore the rabbits head off, threw the still-twitching body at her feet and stormed off. He died of a heart attack in Cessnock Gaol in 1996, aged 75. George Freeman was king of Sydneys SP bookies and was involved with McPherson in massive money laundering operations on Sydney race tracks and the corruption of Sydney chief magistrate Murray Farquar. During the 1970s, George Freeman was shot with a .22 pistol but survived, and, less than six weeks later, the man suspected of the shooting was himself shot dead in the driveway of his Coogee home. Freeman, who was holidaying in Noosa at the time, refused to answer questions on the matter.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.6.</episode-num></programme>

Ask any detective - they will tell you that if they dont have a lead, a suspect or an arrest within 48 hours, their chances of solving the case are cut in half. In a visual style that feels more like a TV drama than a verite reality show, this program follows homicide detectives during these initial critical hours as they race against time to solve their cases. The program follows various detectives of a few select homicide teams as they track breaking cases - each with a running clock that builds pace as the 48 hours inexorably expires. In this episode, Detective Rob Barrere investigates when three men meet in a motel room in New Orleans east, and one of them ends up dead, while in Tulsa, Detective Ronnie Leatherman catches the case of a man stabbed 21 times when a night of drinking ignites a murderous rage.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">18.14.</episode-num></programme>

Now against military convention, he was fighting on two fronts and almost as bad made a bitter enemy of an erstwhile ally. In 1812, Napoleon had sent his troops into Russia under-prepared for Russian winters and hundreds of thousands of his troops perished; now Hitler was about to do the same. The failure to take Moscow and the long, but unsuccessful sieges and Stalingrad and Leningrad cost the Wehrmacht dear; to those under siege it seemed like Earth had transformed itself into hell. Despite near starvation and countless deaths, they somehow survived to see the German army thrown back towards Germany, being chased all the way a Red Army thirsting for revenge. The retreat towards Berlin saw atrocities committed against Russian villagers that were seen by the pursuing Red army and that filled them with yet more hatred. Even the biggest tank battle in history -at Kursk - could not stem the Russian tide.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.8.</episode-num></programme>

The British cause was lost and they soon embarked for home.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.33.</episode-num></programme>

Now against military convention, he was fighting on two fronts and almost as bad made a bitter enemy of an erstwhile ally. In 1812, Napoleon had sent his troops into Russia under-prepared for Russian winters and hundreds of thousands of his troops perished; now Hitler was about to do the same. The failure to take Moscow and the long, but unsuccessful sieges and Stalingrad and Leningrad cost the Wehrmacht dear; to those under siege it seemed like Earth had transformed itself into hell. Despite near starvation and countless deaths, they somehow survived to see the German army thrown back towards Germany, being chased all the way a Red Army thirsting for revenge. The retreat towards Berlin saw atrocities committed against Russian villagers that were seen by the pursuing Red army and that filled them with yet more hatred. Even the biggest tank battle in history -at Kursk - could not stem the Russian tide.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.8.</episode-num></programme>

Now against military convention, he was fighting on two fronts and almost as bad made a bitter enemy of an erstwhile ally. In 1812, Napoleon had sent his troops into Russia under-prepared for Russian winters and hundreds of thousands of his troops perished; now Hitler was about to do the same. The failure to take Moscow and the long, but unsuccessful sieges and Stalingrad and Leningrad cost the Wehrmacht dear; to those under siege it seemed like Earth had transformed itself into hell. Despite near starvation and countless deaths, they somehow survived to see the German army thrown back towards Germany, being chased all the way a Red Army thirsting for revenge. The retreat towards Berlin saw atrocities committed against Russian villagers that were seen by the pursuing Red army and that filled them with yet more hatred.
