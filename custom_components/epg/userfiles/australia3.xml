So when the couple decided to build their first-ever family home in the Adelaide suburb of Hillbank, it was no surprise that the city of churches would provide plenty of inspiration. Not that they want a church-like house. Neil is chasing a barn-inspired house with big, heavy timber beams. So theyve chosen to create a medieval manor built in the traditional way using methods from another time. The bones of the houses eight huge A-frames will be built by hand out of timber by a team of specialist carpenters. Thousands of timber shingles will cover the massive roof, with a two-storey high Gothic glass window the centrepiece of the house. But Neil is constantly let down by suppliers and has grossly underestimated the cost of the build, so work on the site stalls. When summer hits and temperatures soar well into the 40s, the exposed A-frame timber beams begin to warp and crack. They elect to use something straight off a warehouse floor - insulated refrigerator panels on the roof and walls - a most unlikely fit for a medieval house. Not only do they look incongruous, they are hell to work with and expensive. What ensues is a tug of war between old and new materials; between a passion for the past and unsavoury reality. With a blind faith that sees Neil try to ignore spiralling costs, he enlists the help of his family to finish his passion project, turning a build he hoped would last a few months into a five-year revelation.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">6.3.</episode-num></programme>

While one man, Jon Reed, is in prison, found guilty of the first murder, three of the other murders took place while he was in prison. The show explores what it is like for the victims families to exist in limbo for decades, and asks whether present day DNA techniques and modern policing can finally provide a definitive answer as to what really happened to each of the women?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.3.</episode-num></programme>

Unpick the story, reassess the evidence available and trace the timeline of each case to ask if the cases are individual crimes or could potentially tie together. All four women worked for the same airline, and their murders bear striking similarities. While one man, Jon Reed, is in prison, found guilty of the first murder, three of the other murders took place while he was in prison. The show explores what it is like for the victims families to exist in limbo for decades, and asks whether present day DNA techniques and modern policing can finally provide a definitive answer as to what really happened to each of the women?</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.3.</episode-num></programme>

The great battle between the Italian Navy and Britains vastly outnumbered Royal Navy dominated the seas during the early years of the war as both sides sought to support the land campaigns in Egypt and East Africa. At the same time, Britain struggled to maintain its toehold on Malta to ensure that the French fleet did not fall into the hands of the Axis powers. This episode also explores the story of the war in Greece, which was invaded by the Italians in 1940, the Germans in 1941 and finally by the British in 1944. It looks at the constant fight against the German Luftwaffe, which arrived in the Mediterranean in 1941 and did terrible damage to Allied shipping, resulting on the loss of bases in North Africa. The programme also delves into the fascinating story of Operation Mercury, German invasion of Crete, the bloody battle which cost more than 10,000 lives and of the fight for the island of Sicily in 1943, which saw the miraculous evacuation of some 100,000 Axis troops.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.5.</episode-num></programme>

Aerial photographs and dogged local investigation suggest Dinmore Hill was once the site of a vast Iron Age hill fort and the diggers job is to find the evidence to confirm this important discovery. With the site covering some 40 acres, the team expected no shortage of targets to dig, but a frustrated geophys team initially failed to find a single satisfactory target. Undaunted, a 40-metre long trench went in to try to find the immense defensive ditch that was believed to surround the site. But as the end of day one approached, it looked like the diggers were finally beginning to get a grip on this frustrating site. And then the rain started. As trenches were shut for fear of imminent collapse, the archaeologists strive to understand the monument. There are clashes over the purpose and date of the prehistoric archaeology theyre discovering. As the soaked and tired team conclude a gruelling three-day dig, they discover a site that dominated the landscape for over a thousand years and was the ultimate statement of power and status.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">16.11.</episode-num></programme>

The great battle between the Italian Navy and Britains vastly outnumbered Royal Navy dominated the seas during the early years of the war as both sides sought to support the land campaigns in Egypt and East Africa. At the same time, Britain struggled to maintain its toehold on Malta to ensure that the French fleet did not fall into the hands of the Axis powers. This episode also explores the story of the war in Greece, which was invaded by the Italians in 1940, the Germans in 1941 and finally by the British in 1944. It looks at the constant fight against the German Luftwaffe, which arrived in the Mediterranean in 1941 and did terrible damage to Allied shipping, resulting on the loss of bases in North Africa. The programme also delves into the fascinating story of Operation Mercury, German invasion of Crete, the bloody battle which cost more than 10,000 lives and of the fight for the island of Sicily in 1943, which saw the miraculous evacuation of some 100,000 Axis troops.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.5.</episode-num></programme>

Aerial photographs and dogged local investigation suggest Dinmore Hill was once the site of a vast Iron Age hill fort and the diggers job is to find the evidence to confirm this important discovery. With the site covering some 40 acres, the team expected no shortage of targets to dig, but a frustrated geophys team initially failed to find a single satisfactory target. Undaunted, a 40-metre long trench went in to try to find the immense defensive ditch that was believed to surround the site. But as the end of day one approached, it looked like the diggers were finally beginning to get a grip on this frustrating site. And then the rain started. As trenches were shut for fear of imminent collapse, the archaeologists strive to understand the monument. There are clashes over the purpose and date of the prehistoric archaeology theyre discovering. As the soaked and tired team conclude a gruelling three-day dig, they discover a site that dominated the landscape for over a thousand years and was the ultimate statement of power and status.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">16.11.</episode-num></programme>
