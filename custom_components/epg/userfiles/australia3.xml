It produces 60 percent of all pasta made in Italy and supplies 3000 tonnes to the UK each year. Gregg traces the journey the wheat takes through a seven-storey mill and into the production zone where it is mixed with water, pushed through moulds and turned into spaghetti. Along the way, he discovers that the perfect string of spaghetti is 25cm long and examines the technology that allows them to produce 150,000km of it each day, enough to stretch round the Earth almost four times. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey discovers why the best pasta is made with durum wheat. This is a hard wheat that, when it is milled, turns into the granular yellow flour known as semolina, which translates as semi-milled. This is the essential basis of pasta as it retains its shape and texture when cooked. She also helps to harvest 15 tonnes of tomatoes, turning them into 3000L of pasta sauce. Along the way, Cherry is surprised to hear that the British habit of pairing spaghetti with bolognese outrages many Italians. She learns why different shapes of pasta are ideally paired with different sauces, and promises in future she will serve her spaghetti with a more suitable topping, like carbonara. Historian Ruth Goodman discovers that pasta arrived in Britain much earlier than we imagined. She heads to the British Library to look at a manuscript from 1390, a cookbook written for King Richard II which contains a recipe for something called lozyns. Ruth cooks up a batch and is convinced that this an early version of lasagne. She also navigates the streets of Soho armed with a 1958 restaurant guide to find out how we first fell in love with Italian food.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.1.</episode-num></programme>

He follows the production of chocolate digestives, from the arrival of 28 tonnes of flour right through to dispatch. Along the way, he discovers that the biscuits are shaped by a bronze roller costing up to 10,000 pounds, and that the chocolate is added to the bottom not the top of the biscuits, meaning we are all eating them the wrong way up. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is on the trail of that chocolate. At the refinery in Manchester, she learns that it is transported in heated lorries kept at 50 degrees to stop it solidifying on its way to the factory. She also discovers that this is the most expensive ingredient, at around 2000 pounds per tonne. In Nottingham Universitys sensory lab, she finds scientific proof that dunking your biscuit improves its flavour and that tea is the best liquid to dunk in. Cherry takes to the streets to see if that stacks up in the real world. Historian Ruth Goodman investigates the link between biscuits and digestion. She finds references in Samuel Pepyss diary to biscuits being a cure for flatulence and digestive discomfort, and discovers that in Victorian times it was thought that biscuits could cure everything from typhoid to scarlet fever. She also takes a look at an antique biscuit baked at the beginning of the 20th century, one of Huntley and Palmers notorious army biscuits. These dry, hard biscuits were supplied as rations to five million British soldiers on the frontline in the First World War.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.2.</episode-num></programme>

He follows the production of chocolate digestives, from the arrival of 28 tonnes of flour right through to dispatch. Along the way, he discovers that the biscuits are shaped by a bronze roller costing up to 10,000 pounds, and that the chocolate is added to the bottom not the top of the biscuits, meaning we are all eating them the wrong way up. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey is on the trail of that chocolate. At the refinery in Manchester, she learns that it is transported in heated lorries kept at 50 degrees to stop it solidifying on its way to the factory. She also discovers that this is the most expensive ingredient, at around 2000 pounds per tonne. In Nottingham Universitys sensory lab, she finds scientific proof that dunking your biscuit improves its flavour and that tea is the best liquid to dunk in. Cherry takes to the streets to see if that stacks up in the real world. Historian Ruth Goodman investigates the link between biscuits and digestion. She finds references in Samuel Pepyss diary to biscuits being a cure for flatulence and digestive discomfort, and discovers that in Victorian times it was thought that biscuits could cure everything from typhoid to scarlet fever. She also takes a look at an antique biscuit baked at the beginning of the 20th century, one of Huntley and Palmers notorious army biscuits. These dry, hard biscuits were supplied as rations to five million British soldiers on the frontline in the First World War.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.2.</episode-num></programme>

Cod arrives at the factory as compressed blocks of frozen fish. The blocks weigh exactly 7.484kg, which is a standardised measure in every fish factory right across the world. Gregg watches as each block is cut into 168 naked fish fingers which are then floured, battered and breaded, ready for a quick 45-second trip through the fryer. He also helps take delivery of 25 tonnes of liquid nitrogen, used to flash freeze the fingers at -15 degrees, but Gregg is amazed to discover that the fish inside the finger remains frozen through every stage of production, right up to the moment you cook it at home. Meanwhile, Cherry Healey travels to Grindavik, Iceland, where they land up to 50 tonnes of cod a day. She follows the fish through the processing factory, even trying her hand at gutting the fish. Historian Ruth Goodman is investigating the origins of cod fish fingers. She finds that Birds Eye were the first to introduce them to the UK, basing them on a US product called fish sticks.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.3.</episode-num></programme>

The nation held their breath as the hours, days and weeks rolled on, in the desperate hope to find her alive. But on October 6, a local man, Mark Bridger, was charged with her abduction and murder.

The dark plot would result in only Joes death. The twisted crime became notorious for its chilling cruelty and bizarre plot which led to Singh being found guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. She was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, but was released early in 2001. A 25-year-old law student of the Australian National University, Anu Singh invited friends to two dinner parties and told them that a terrible crime would be committed. After the first dinner party, Singh made an aborted attempt to kill Joe. Her second attempt was tragically more successful, and Joe Cinque died two days later. The toxicology reports showed high levels of heroin and Rohypnol in his body. This program features interviews with those close to the case, including Joe Cinques parents Maria and Nino (who sadly passed away during the making of this program), Nino and Marias godson Robert Terrone, psychiatrist for the Crown Dr Michael Diamond, forensic psychiatrist Paul Mullen, Anu Singhs barrister Jack Pappas, Australian Federal Police officer Greg Ranse, and first responder Gina Kikos from ACT Fire and Rescue.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.4.</episode-num></programme>

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze.

For over 100 years, since the first semi-successful attempts during the American Civil War, submarine warfare had been fraught with difficulties and failure. In 1901, the Holland I was launched as the first Royal Navy submarine, and submarines have been an integral part of the navy ever since. WWII showed the first widespread use of these underwater vessels and their major advantages. Nuclear submarines roam the waters all over the world for exploration and to keep the peace. Featuring rare archive footage, stunning 3D computer graphics and rare film of the last surviving submarines, this is a privileged glimpse into the world of submarine warfare.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num></programme>

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze. Often the blaze stoked such animosities that the fires of intrigue and betrayal never went out.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.12.</episode-num></programme>

For over 100 years, since the first semi-successful attempts during the American Civil War, submarine warfare had been fraught with difficulties and failure. In 1901, the Holland I was launched as the first Royal Navy submarine, and submarines have been an integral part of the navy ever since. WWII showed the first widespread use of these underwater vessels and their major advantages. Nuclear submarines roam the waters all over the world for exploration and to keep the peace. Featuring rare archive footage, stunning 3D computer graphics and rare film of the last surviving submarines, this is a privileged glimpse into the world of submarine warfare.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.2.</episode-num></programme>

When the pilot parachuted out, his captors were astonished to discover that he was no ordinary German, but Rudolph Hess, the Deputy Fuehrer of Nazi Germany. He had come to visit members of the royal family on a secret peace mission that he hoped would end the war. Instead, he spent the rest of his life in Spandau prison, where he died at age 92. However, theories have surfaced suggesting that it was not Hess who died in prison.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.12.</episode-num></programme>

Germany was no longer allowed by international law to possess an airforce. Secretly, through the 20s and 30s, Germany began to rebuild her military capabilities, first in Russia and then in Italy. The Luftwaffe was reborn. In 1939, Hitler invaded Poland and the German air force was at the head of his invasion force. During the course of the war, the Luftwaffe was slowly ground down, but lack of resources and poor leadership contributed to a steady decline of this once proud fighting force. Featuring rare archive footage, stunning 3D computer graphics and rare film of the last surviving planes, this is a privileged glimpse into the world of Hitlers air force.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.3.</episode-num></programme>

From behind its perimeter ramparts the hilltop offers commanding views of the Thames and the surrounding Oxfordshire landscape, but it is dwarfed and overlooked by a neighbouring hill less than 150 metres away. What did the Iron Age tribe use this second, much larger hill for? Was it a ritual site where they buried their dead? Or did the people who built the fort live on its slopes? After some initial setbacks and a bit of trouble with the local newts, the team find the answer in a surprising place, gradually piecing together one of the most extensive Iron Age landscapes ever discovered in Britain.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">10.8.</episode-num></programme>
