Letter-writing became the repository of Trumbos extraordinary talents, and these correspondences serve as a wonderfully entertaining testament to the need for self-expression, social and political involvement, and remaining fallibly human in the face of barbarism. Told through performances of some of these extraordinary letters, by an award-winning cast of actors, archival and contemporary interviews and clips from his films, Trumbo illustrates how his unerring belief in the freedom of speech and the power of the written word allowed him to fight against political persecution.</desc></programme>

Letter-writing became the repository of Trumbos extraordinary talents, and these correspondences serve as a wonderfully entertaining testament to the need for self-expression, social and political involvement, and remaining fallibly human in the face of barbarism. Told through performances of some of these extraordinary letters, by an award-winning cast of actors, archival and contemporary interviews and clips from his films, Trumbo illustrates how his unerring belief in the freedom of speech and the power of the written word allowed him to fight against political persecution.</desc></programme>

Both sailors, while on shore leave in Sydney, were approached by a man who asked the question: "Young man, if you were to die tonight, where would you be, in heaven or in hell?" In the course of time they both returned home, but the encounter with this mysterious man on George Street, Sydney, left such a deep impression on their hearts and minds that they both sought spiritual help when back in England, both becoming Christians. Who was this unconventional street-evangelist? Why had he chosen to act in such a way? And how many other people had been impacted by his ministry? This is the story of Frank Jenner, The George Street Evangelist. Simply asking a question about eternity, he lead many men and woman to faith in Jesus Christ.

The town drunk and a local nursing aide soon fingered two men as the killers, among them, Randy Steidl. Even Steidls brother, an Illinois cop, thought he was guilty, and Randy received the death penalty. But when Michael Callahan, a promising young cop with the Illinois State Police, started looking at the case, he encountered lies, corruption and evidence of guilt pointing to just about everyone in Illinois except Randy Steidl. Even after Callahans bosses tried to silence him, he pursued the case - costing him his job, but eventually helping free Randy Steidl from death row.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.3.</episode-num></programme>

But after the flames were put out, investigators discovered the pair had been stabbed to death before arson consumed their home. The town drunk and a local nursing aide soon fingered two men as the killers, among them, Randy Steidl. Even Steidls brother, an Illinois cop, thought he was guilty, and Randy received the death penalty. But when Michael Callahan, a promising young cop with the Illinois State Police, started looking at the case, he encountered lies, corruption and evidence of guilt pointing to just about everyone in Illinois except Randy Steidl. Even after Callahans bosses tried to silence him, he pursued the case - costing him his job, but eventually helping free Randy Steidl from death row.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.3.</episode-num></programme>

He said he had buried Aston in a shallow grave in scrubland about 60km south, over the New South Wales border near the seaside hamlet of Kingscliff.

The men used their Vauxhall Tigra to strike the soldier from behind as he crossed the road. They then proceeded to use knives to hack at Lees body in an attempt to decapitate him before dumping him in the middle of the road. These sickening events were caught on camera phones by horrified onlookers and the killers were filmed claiming to have carried out the attack in the name of Allah. In a dramatic sequence of events, police arrived at the scene within minutes and shot at the two men as they ran towards them holding up their weapons. Both Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey. In this programme we speak to witnesses to the attack and experts on terrorism to examine how two young British men could be radicalised to such an extent that they killed an innocent man in the name of religion.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.1.</episode-num></programme>

The men used their Vauxhall Tigra to strike the soldier from behind as he crossed the road. They then proceeded to use knives to hack at Lees body in an attempt to decapitate him before dumping him in the middle of the road. These sickening events were caught on camera phones by horrified onlookers and the killers were filmed claiming to have carried out the attack in the name of Allah. In a dramatic sequence of events, police arrived at the scene within minutes and shot at the two men as they ran towards them holding up their weapons. Both Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey. In this programme we speak to witnesses to the attack and experts on terrorism to examine how two young British men could be radicalised to such an extent that they killed an innocent man in the name of religion.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">4.1.</episode-num></programme>

It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger.

While the Red Army engaged the Third Reich in the East, Britain and its Allies stalled over opening up a Western Front. Churchill tried to placate Stalins howls of rage by initiating a saturation bombing campaign of Germany. The Allies also waged another deadly war on the ground. That war was secret. It involved countless acts of courage, ruthlessness, double-dealing and betrayal. No agent anywhere on the continent ever knew who they could trust. Some people became double agents as they believed it the best strategy for staying alive. Some played both sides for the thrill of the danger. This is the story of the operations and the people who waged the secret war and set Europe ablaze. Often the blaze stoked such animosities that the fires of intrigue and betrayal never went out.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.6.</episode-num></programme>

German U-boats tried to cut off Britain from vital US supplies. If they succeeded, the Allies would almost certainly lose the war. Led by Admiral Karl Doenitz, U-boat packs roamed the sea hunting their prey and nearly starved Britain into surrender. Featuring interviews with U-boat officers and footage of U-boats at work, we see how Germany was at the forefront of technology and how the Allies fought back to win the Battle of the Atlantic.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.5.</episode-num></programme>

In his quest, Finn has sunk everything he has, including his marriage to Tess Finnegan. Just as Tess has begun to rebuild her life, working aboard a mega-yacht owned by billionaire Nigel Honeycutt, Finn discovers a vital clue to the treasures whereabouts. Much to Tess consternation, Finn manoeuvres himself aboard Nigels yacht and, using his roguish charm, convinces the tycoon and his daughter, Gemma, to join him in the pursuit of the Spanish treasure. But they are not the only ones after the prize. Finns one-time mentor, Moe Fitch, and a ruthless local gangster are intent on beating Finn to the prize. Let the treasure hunt begin.</desc></programme>
