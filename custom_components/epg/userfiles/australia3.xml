Cocaine Cowboys 2: Hustlin with the Godmother picks up where the rip-roaring original leaves off. The story of greed, drugs, sex and crime has been transported from the cocaine-coated streets of 80s Miami to 90s Oakland, where crack is the new drug of choice. Drug baroness Griselda Blanco-whose name is attached to over 250 murders-is behind bars, but thanks to her devoted toy boy Charles Cosby, her business still thrives. But when the Black Widows paranoia worsens, it seems that Cosby is destined to become yet another notch in her murderous belt. Fast-paced, gritty and terrifyingly real, this special takes us into the sleazy, cash-fuelled world of drug front-runners, and introduces us to the woman who made even the most hard-edged criminals cower.</desc></programme>

It is the first full-length feature film project that is told through the eyes of the members of the Bra Boys. It is their story. It shows their success in professional big wave surfing, it explores their international reputation for hard partying and rough justice, it touches on their running battle with authorities and it shows their absolute reliance on one another to fit into a society in which they are displaced and, at times, disinterested. Narrated by Australian actor Russell Crowe, this film looks at the evolution of the suburb of Maroubra, coupled with the historical stigma associated with Australias rebellious surf community. Central to the story is the true-life struggle of the Abberton brothers - Sunny, Koby, Jai and Dakota - one charged with murdering a Sydney standover man, another pursuing a professional surf career but charged as an accessory in his brothers legal fight, another trying to hold the family together and a young brother whose inheritance is his siblings notoriety. The film uses rare archival footage blended with incredible surf vision and intimate interviews to create a story that is both compassionate and exhilarating. Being a Bra Boy is about holding your ground - about brotherhood, honour, loyalty and family, in all its forms. The film is a story of contrast involving against-the-odds success and probable failures and, ultimately, explores the legacy and hopes of this and the next generation of a uniquely Australian community.</desc></programme>

Cocaine Cowboys 2: Hustlin with the Godmother picks up where the rip-roaring original leaves off. The story of greed, drugs, sex and crime has been transported from the cocaine-coated streets of 80s Miami to 90s Oakland, where crack is the new drug of choice. Drug baroness Griselda Blanco-whose name is attached to over 250 murders-is behind bars, but thanks to her devoted toy boy Charles Cosby, her business still thrives.

The before and after reveals of his work are always highlights, in part because of the history nuggets Rick Dale shares about each object, whether its a barber chair or a gas pump. In this spinoff series, featuring the dynamic characters at Ricks workplace, viewers will watch a variety of objects be bought, bartered and transformed, learning the process of restoration; how do you duplicate Coke machine red? Where can you find 1920s tires? A storyteller who works with tools instead of a pen, Rick shares when and why objects were invented, who used them and how fixing or transforming them changes their value.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.13.</episode-num></programme>

Three innocent men were attacked and thrown to their deaths from a cliff top. The murders were part of a much wider wave of violent hate crimes as gangs of youths roamed Sydneys inner suburbs randomly bashing and killing gay men for sport. Among the victims at Bondi was Wollongong television newsreader Ross Warren, a gay man who disappeared while visiting friends in Sydney in 1989.
