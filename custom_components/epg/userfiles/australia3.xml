Hes got a cushy job stamping invoices at an electronics superstore, a nice apartment with a proud collection of action figures and comic books, good friends, a nice attitude. But theres just one little thing he hasnt quite gotten around to doing yet - something most people have done by his age. Done a lot. Andys never, ever, ever had sex - not even by accident. So is that such a big deal? Well, for Andys buds at the store, it sure is. Although they think hes a bit of an oddball, theres certainly a planet full of stranger (and homelier) guys whove at least had one go at having a go. They consider it their duty to help Andy out of his dire situation and go to great lengths to help him.</desc></programme>

He invites Lucas to scour the items to see what he can get good money for, as hed like to be able to give his adult children some much needed cash. On Sydney Harbour Lucas has arranged to meet two divers who collect bottles. They dig deep below the sandy bottom of the harbour to find pieces that stretch back to Sydneys colonial days. Lucas realises there could be good money in their pieces, so he visits a bottle fair to talk to the experts, where he learns that some bottles sell for as much as $20,000 each! Meanwhile, Lucas gets a call from Bill - who has an 1820s bibles the he thinks could be worth big bucks - but some classic mid-century chairs rotting in the weather in Bills backyard catch Lucas eye while hes there.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.4.</episode-num></programme>

First filmed in 1947 at beautiful, historic Biltmore House, it has long been considered a Christmas classic.

Until a brutal rape and murder destroys that dream for one resident, 84-year-old retired psychiatrist Gladys Conrad. Police are left scrambling to find her killer and a motive for murder. With no valuables taken from the scene and no signs of forced entry, investigators think it could be an inside job committed by a violent sexual predator. Challenged by a severe lack of evidence, investigators catch a major break that becomes the lynch pin of the investigation - the killers DNA profile. An unrelated sexual assault attempt in Los Angeles, three years after Conrads murder, gives them a DNA match and a composite sketch of the killer. But they still dont have a name. Years later a suspect arrested on unrelated charges turns out to have the same DNA profile as both the Conrad and LA cases. But before the detectives can track him down, he is deported to Mexico. At every turn the investigation hits a snag but the detectives refuse to give up, haunted by the vicious murder of a defenceless elderly woman.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.1.</episode-num></programme>

The second victim is a former state senator embroiled in an FBI investigation for fraud. Detectives wonder if an embittered foe sought revenge or if it was the victims homosexuality that made him a target. After a composite sketch is released and a ballistics report confirms that the same type of gun executed both murders, a key suspect is fingered. When the police receive an anonymous letter from The Aids Commission, an anti-gay group, that takes responsibility for the murders, the investigators turn their attention to a different suspect.

That is, until gunfire rips through two city parks popular for cruising, leaving two men dead and one critically wounded. Police race to determine a connection between the cases and a motive for the murders. The investigation is complicated. The crime scenes are messy. The media attention is glaring. The second victim is a former state senator embroiled in an FBI investigation for fraud. Detectives wonder if an embittered foe sought revenge or if it was the victims homosexuality that made him a target. After a composite sketch is released and a ballistics report confirms that the same type of gun executed both murders, a key suspect is fingered. When the police receive an anonymous letter from The Aids Commission, an anti-gay group, that takes responsibility for the murders, the investigators turn their attention to a different suspect. Its clear that a hate group is on a mission of mass murder.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.5.</episode-num></programme>

The police rush to establish motive and solve the towns first murders in over a century. The CSI unit combs the scene and finds nothing valuable is missing. However, blood splatter analysis shows they are looking for more than one killer. The family rumour mill points to the black sheep of the Stock clan, Matt Livers. Family members say he threatened Wayne the day before the murders. Matt says hes innocent but he fails a polygraph. After hours of intense interrogation he cracks and confesses. Matt also implicates his cousin, Nick Sampson. But two days later Matt recants and the case stalls. That is until investigators focus on a gold ring found on the kitchen floor of the farmhouse. Forensic tests find traces of the victims blood and an unknown womans DNA on the ring. When investigators trace the ring to a stolen truck in Wisconsin and teenage lovers on a drug-fuelled crime spree, suddenly detectives have four prime suspects. To make things worse, there are allegations that investigators planted evidence. Now, not only Murdock, but all of Nebraska wants to know who really murdered Wayne and Sharmon Stock.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.4.</episode-num></programme>

Until a brutal rape and murder destroys that dream for one resident, 84-year-old retired psychiatrist Gladys Conrad. Police are left scrambling to find her killer and a motive for murder. With no valuables taken from the scene and no signs of forced entry, investigators think it could be an inside job committed by a violent sexual predator. Challenged by a severe lack of evidence, investigators catch a major break that becomes the lynch pin of the investigation - the killers DNA profile. An unrelated sexual assault attempt in Los Angeles, three years after Conrads murder, gives them a DNA match and a composite sketch of the killer. But they still dont have a name. Years later a suspect arrested on unrelated charges turns out to have the same DNA profile as both the Conrad and LA cases. But before the detectives can track him down, he is deported to Mexico. At every turn the investigation hits a snag but the detectives refuse to give up, haunted by the vicious murder of a defenceless elderly woman.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.1.</episode-num></programme>

Until a brutal rape and murder destroys that dream for one resident, 84-year-old retired psychiatrist Gladys Conrad. Police are left scrambling to find her killer and a motive for murder. With no valuables taken from the scene and no signs of forced entry, investigators think it could be an inside job committed by a violent sexual predator. Challenged by a severe lack of evidence, investigators catch a major break that becomes the lynch pin of the investigation - the killers DNA profile. An unrelated sexual assault attempt in Los Angeles, three years after Conrads murder, gives them a DNA match and a composite sketch of the killer. But they still dont have a name. Years later a suspect arrested on unrelated charges turns out to have the same DNA profile as both the Conrad and LA cases. But before the detectives can track him down, he is deported to Mexico. At every turn the investigation hits a snag but the detectives refuse to give up, haunted by the vicious murder of a defenceless elderly woman.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.1.</episode-num></programme>

In 1997, Leslie Camilleri and Lindsay Becket abducted two teenagers: 14-year-old Lauren Barry and 16-year-old Nichole Collins. The girls were camping with friends only a few kilometres from home when they decided to leave the camp to visit friends. As they emerged from the bush, they were picked up by Camilleri and Beckett. They were driven across the state of Victoria and subjected to nine hours of rape and torture. After the harrowing ordeal, the two friends were stabbed to death and buried in scrubland near Fiddlers Green Creek. Their brutal and heartbreaking deaths still shock the nation to this day. Camilleri was imprisoned with no chance of release. Beckett was sentenced to a minimum of 35 years in prison. This documentary includes interviews with friends and relatives of the two girls including Laurens brother Nathan and friends Rebecca Barber and Sarah (surname withheld). The program also includes a revealing interview with the detective who led the investigation, who details how the killers were tracked down and convicted of the notorious crime.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.1.</episode-num></programme>

The police rush to establish motive and solve the towns first murders in over a century. The CSI unit combs the scene and finds nothing valuable is missing. However, blood splatter analysis shows they are looking for more than one killer. The family rumour mill points to the black sheep of the Stock clan, Matt Livers. Family members say he threatened Wayne the day before the murders. Matt says hes innocent but he fails a polygraph. After hours of intense interrogation he cracks and confesses. Matt also implicates his cousin, Nick Sampson. But two days later Matt recants and the case stalls. That is until investigators focus on a gold ring found on the kitchen floor of the farmhouse. Forensic tests find traces of the victims blood and an unknown womans DNA on the ring. When investigators trace the ring to a stolen truck in Wisconsin and teenage lovers on a drug-fuelled crime spree, suddenly detectives have four prime suspects. To make things worse, there are allegations that investigators planted evidence. Now, not only Murdock, but all of Nebraska wants to know who really murdered Wayne and Sharmon Stock.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.4.</episode-num></programme>

But even now, the outcome was in the balance. The film explores the Allied disaster at Arnhem and the tragedy of the Warsaw uprising, when Polish freedom fighters were abandoned to their fate by Stalin. It tells the shocking story of the liberation of the death camps, when the full extent of the Holocaust became clear for the first time. The film ends with Hitlers last great gamble, as he threw all his last reserves against the oncoming Allied forces in the Ardennes. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed particularly in the last five to 10 years, when documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict.

The Italian ships, thought to be virtually immune to air attack, were protected by anti-torpedo nets, and surrounded by barrage balloons and anti-aircraft defences. But, in less than two hours, the lumbering Swordfish torpedo bombers were able to sink or disable three battleships and several cruisers, and severely damage port installations.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.12.</episode-num></programme>

But even now, the outcome was in the balance. The film explores the Allied disaster at Arnhem and the tragedy of the Warsaw uprising, when Polish freedom fighters were abandoned to their fate by Stalin. It tells the shocking story of the liberation of the death camps, when the full extent of the Holocaust became clear for the first time. The film ends with Hitlers last great gamble, as he threw all his last reserves against the oncoming Allied forces in the Ardennes. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed particularly in the last five to 10 years, when documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict.

Born in Stirling Castle in 1594, he was the eldest son and heir of King James the VI and I of the United Kingdom. From an early age, the young prince was hidden away by the King for security reasons; but later, after he joined his father in England as the first Scottish Prince of Wales, Henry became a mesmerising star of the first decade of the Stuart dynastys rule over the tumultuous 1600s. Paul begins his quest in Stirling Castle and meets historian and author, Sarah Fraser, who helps to uncover Henrys early life, as well as learning about how the lost princes legacy changed history when the British Empire took its first steps into North America, under Henrys patronage.

Born in Stirling Castle in 1594, he was the eldest son and heir of King James the VI and I of the United Kingdom. From an early age, the young prince was hidden away by the King for security reasons; but later, after he joined his father in England as the first Scottish Prince of Wales, Henry became a mesmerising star of the first decade of the Stuart dynastys rule over the tumultuous 1600s. Paul begins his quest in Stirling Castle and meets historian and author, Sarah Fraser, who helps to uncover Henrys early life, as well as learning about how the lost princes legacy changed history when the British Empire took its first steps into North America, under Henrys patronage. This detective story, reveals the tragedy of Henrys lost potential, as this forgotten figure is brought from the shadows of history into the light of the modern world and how ultimately, his brother, Charles I ended up as King.</desc></programme>

They were told they lacked the intelligence to handle modern fighter aircraft. They were not supposed to succeed. But in the face of bigotry and ignorance the Tuskegee Airmen prevailed. With skill and bravery the squadron shattered racist stereotypes and their exploits became the stuff of legend. On July 18, 1944, pilots Wendell Pruitt and Lee Archer, the Gruesome Twosome, soar into battle over the Po river valley in Northern Italy. When German fighters attack the bomber stream theyre tasked to protect Pruitt and Archer move to intercept. After a gruelling dogfight Archer manages to shoot down the German, his first victory. Elsewhere in the bomber stream, pilot Lucky Lester moves to engage a flight of four Me109s. After quickly dispatching the first 109 he nearly collides with the debris of the downed plane. Then, he quickly downs two more. At the end of the day, the Tuskegee Airmen score nine victories, their highest total for a single day yet. On August 24, 1944, pilot Charles McGee cruises towards Czechoslovakia. He and the rest of the Tuskegee Airmen are escorting bombers to an airfield in Pardubice. McGee spots an Fw190 trying to attack the bombers and quickly intercepts it. The 190 leads him on a wild chase across a burning airfield before he finally manages to knock it down. October 12, 1944: While returning to base after an escort mission Pruitt, Archer, and the rest of the Tuskegee Airmen encounter a huge formation of German aircraft. The skies explode, machine guns chatter, engines roar. In the frantic action Archer manages to down three aircraft bringing his war total to five. The Tuskegee Airmen now have an ace. March 24, 1945: The Tuskegee Airmen escort a bomber stream to Berlin. Pilot Roscoe Brown is among them. Just south of Berlin the Germans send Me262s, a jet fighter, to attack the Americans. The Tuskegee Airmen manage to down an incredible three 262s.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.16.</episode-num></programme>

Flames fill the cockpit and the aircraft plummets in a wild spin. But time and again the pilot of a P-47 Thunderbolt pulls out and keeps on fighting. Over occupied Europe, the P-47 Thunderbolt blazed a reputation as the most rugged fighter of WWII. Pilot Robert S Johnson flies with the renowned 56th fighter group. His flight is jumped by 16 deadly Focke-Wulf 190s. As hundreds of enemy rounds impact his fighter, Johnsons life depends on the legendary protection his armoured cockpit affords. In June 1944, Lt George Sutcliffe enters the fight of his life in an effort to escape 40-plus Me109s looming above him. The Thunderbolts defensive capabilities inspired confidence in its pilots.

The Japanese were driven back across the ocean, island by island, in savage hand-to-hand fighting. American dominance at sea was finally established in the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot, when radar gave the US Navy Advance warning of a huge Japanese attack and the last vestiges of Japanese naval air power were destroyed. But this film also looks at the war in the jungles, in places such as Burma, where new specialist fighting units - like Ord Wingates Chindits - slowly pushed back the Japanese despite horrific conditions. Conventional wisdom has recently changed as more and more secrets have been revealed particularly in the last five to 10 years, when documents, files and photographs have been released. Code-breaking revelations and newly released government papers on both sides of the Atlantic have added a very insightful new dimension to the understanding of this, the worlds greatest ever conflict.

They were told they lacked the intelligence to handle modern fighter aircraft. They were not supposed to succeed. But in the face of bigotry and ignorance the Tuskegee Airmen prevailed. With skill and bravery the squadron shattered racist stereotypes and their exploits became the stuff of legend. On July 18, 1944, pilots Wendell Pruitt and Lee Archer, the Gruesome Twosome, soar into battle over the Po river valley in Northern Italy. When German fighters attack the bomber stream theyre tasked to protect Pruitt and Archer move to intercept. After a gruelling dogfight Archer manages to shoot down the German, his first victory. Elsewhere in the bomber stream, pilot Lucky Lester moves to engage a flight of four Me109s. After quickly dispatching the first 109 he nearly collides with the debris of the downed plane. Then, he quickly downs two more. At the end of the day, the Tuskegee Airmen score nine victories, their highest total for a single day yet. On August 24, 1944, pilot Charles McGee cruises towards Czechoslovakia. He and the rest of the Tuskegee Airmen are escorting bombers to an airfield in Pardubice. McGee spots an Fw190 trying to attack the bombers and quickly intercepts it. The 190 leads him on a wild chase across a burning airfield before he finally manages to knock it down. October 12, 1944: While returning to base after an escort mission Pruitt, Archer, and the rest of the Tuskegee Airmen encounter a huge formation of German aircraft. The skies explode, machine guns chatter, engines roar. In the frantic action Archer manages to down three aircraft bringing his war total to five. The Tuskegee Airmen now have an ace. March 24, 1945: The Tuskegee Airmen escort a bomber stream to Berlin. Pilot Roscoe Brown is among them. Just south of Berlin the Germans send Me262s, a jet fighter, to attack the Americans. The Tuskegee Airmen manage to down an incredible three 262s.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.16.</episode-num></programme>

So does the impact of this tender, movingly filmed tale.</desc></programme>
