ACC.au"><title>PowerPoint with Jack Graham</title><desc>PowerPoint Ministries started as a vision of Dr Jack Graham and his wife, Deb, 20 years ago. They believed that the power of God was evident in their growing church and that His Gospel message should be spread beyond the walls of that church to the world at large. They put their faith into action and purchased airtime on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. PowerPoint Ministries was then officially launched in April 1994. Over the past 19 years, PowerPoint Ministries has grown to an expansive network of local, national, and international television and radio broadcasts. In fact, PowerPoint can be seen or heard by a potential audience of millions of television viewers and radio listeners across the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, Iran, Russia, Israel and more.

Both sailors, while on shore leave in Sydney, were approached by a man who asked the question: "Young man, if you were to die tonight, where would you be, in heaven or in hell?" In the course of time they both returned home, but the encounter with this mysterious man on George Street, Sydney, left such a deep impression on their hearts and minds that they both sought spiritual help when back in England, both becoming Christians. Who was this unconventional street-evangelist? Why had he chosen to act in such a way? And how many other people had been impacted by his ministry? This is the story of Frank Jenner, The George Street Evangelist. Simply asking a question about eternity, he lead many men and woman to faith in Jesus Christ. Sydneys soul winning sailor is estimated to have witnessed to 100,000 people.</desc></programme>

Jennifer Saunders hosts this second episode as four celebrities face their three challenges set by judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood. The bakers on the starting line are former Labour politician Ed Balls, writer and presenter Victoria Coren Mitchell, sports commentator Chris Kamara, and singer and actor Kimberley Walsh. The bakers must make 24 identical American-style muffins for their signature challenge, football pies in the technical challenge and, finally, show-stopping tiered cakes representing an extreme sport. Interesting flavours and confusion abound in this baking battle. Who will bag the coveted title of star baker? While the bakers aim to inspire others to raise money, Denise Lewis visits a project in Tyne and Wear where she meets Linda and Hughie. Hughie was diagnosed with dementia six years ago at the age of 59. Denise finds out how money raised really does make a difference to his quality of life.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">1.1.</episode-num></programme>

Despite its central role in the conflicts between church and state throughout the 16th century, very little is known about Syon Abbey. What sort of layout did it have? How big was it?
