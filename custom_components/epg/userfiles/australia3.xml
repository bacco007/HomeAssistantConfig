From a young age, he thrived in his familys adventurous lifestyle, so its not surprising that Matt became a world-class professional athlete in the dangerous sport of wake boarding. Even a tragic, nearly fatal accident requiring months of recovery could not keep Matt away from the water. That was just the beginning of his story. As young newlyweds with a baby on the way, Matt and his wife Bobbye Jean experienced another tragic accident, only this time a miracle seemed impossible. The second accident, an encounter with 14,000 volts of electricity (the equivalent of six electric chairs) left Matt burnt beyond recognition and lying at deaths doorstep. Bobbye prepared to say goodbye along with close friends and family. However, miracles started to become a way of life for Matt, who saw Gods hand in every step. In this inspiring documentary, Matt tells his unbelievable story of survival and how, through it, Gods power was perfected in his weakness.</desc></programme>

Police investigators found that Frank Jarvis Atwood, released after serving time for two child molestation convictions in California, had been in the Tucson area but was now gone. The FBI decided to confiscate Atwoods car to search for forensic evidence. The nickel on the bike was tested and found to be the same as the nickel on Atwoods bumper.

When Morgan was only three months old, she suffered a sleep apnea episode and was admitted to the hospital for four days. Morgan continued to experience occasional apnea episodes, and her last attack was on February 7, 1984. Little Morgan did not respond to resuscitation, and died. On May 2, 1985, Tanya Reid gave birth again, this time to a son named Brandon Michael. Brandon was hospitalized over 20 times during the next two years. When Brandon was temporarily taken away from his mother, he did not experience any seizures or apnea episodes. When prosecutors asked pathologists to re-open Morgans autopsy records, they discovered that an x-ray taken during the autopsy revealed that she did not die of SIDS but showed brain damage consistent with being shaken violently. The outcome of the first of Tanyas trials ended in a conviction for felony child endangerment of Brandon Michael, and was found guilty of the murder of her daughter, a conviction that was overturned by an appellate court.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.11.</episode-num></programme>

Her boyfriend, John Ortiz-Kehoe, and her childhood friend, Billy Brown, told police they saw her early on December 7, but they had no idea where she went after they last saw her. Two years later, an investigation revealed that Billy Brown and John Kehoe were both local drug users and dealers. When Billy Brown heard about this, he feared he might be implicated and decided to cooperate with police. He told them that Rose Larner was murdered by John Kehoe two years earlier, in his grandparents home. According to Billy Brown, Larner refused to participate in a threesome, and Kehoe strangled her, placed her in the shower, slit her throat and dismembered her body. Police compared a tiny blood spec found at Kehoes grandparents home, to a blood sample taken from Rose Larner four years before the murder. Kehoe was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Billy Brown was convicted for being an accessory, but as part of the deal, in which he gave up Kehoe, Brown served only a year in prison.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.12.</episode-num></programme>

She never returned home. Vickis bike was found abandoned later that afternoon on a nearby street, slightly damaged, but there was no sign of her. Police investigators found that Frank Jarvis Atwood, released after serving time for two child molestation convictions in California, had been in the Tucson area but was now gone. The FBI decided to confiscate Atwoods car to search for forensic evidence. The nickel on the bike was tested and found to be the same as the nickel on Atwoods bumper.

When Morgan was only three months old, she suffered a sleep apnea episode and was admitted to the hospital for four days. Morgan continued to experience occasional apnea episodes, and her last attack was on February 7, 1984. Little Morgan did not respond to resuscitation, and died. On May 2, 1985, Tanya Reid gave birth again, this time to a son named Brandon Michael. Brandon was hospitalized over 20 times during the next two years. When Brandon was temporarily taken away from his mother, he did not experience any seizures or apnea episodes. When prosecutors asked pathologists to re-open Morgans autopsy records, they discovered that an x-ray taken during the autopsy revealed that she did not die of SIDS but showed brain damage consistent with being shaken violently. The outcome of the first of Tanyas trials ended in a conviction for felony child endangerment of Brandon Michael, and was found guilty of the murder of her daughter, a conviction that was overturned by an appellate court.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.11.</episode-num></programme>

Her boyfriend, John Ortiz-Kehoe, and her childhood friend, Billy Brown, told police they saw her early on December 7, but they had no idea where she went after they last saw her. Two years later, an investigation revealed that Billy Brown and John Kehoe were both local drug users and dealers. When Billy Brown heard about this, he feared he might be implicated and decided to cooperate with police. He told them that Rose Larner was murdered by John Kehoe two years earlier, in his grandparents home. According to Billy Brown, Larner refused to participate in a threesome, and Kehoe strangled her, placed her in the shower, slit her throat and dismembered her body. Police compared a tiny blood spec found at Kehoes grandparents home, to a blood sample taken from Rose Larner four years before the murder. Kehoe was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Billy Brown was convicted for being an accessory, but as part of the deal, in which he gave up Kehoe, Brown served only a year in prison.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.12.</episode-num></programme>

He was there on a little sojourn, having a look at the site of a 13th century hospital of which parts are still visible, interwoven into the fabric of the existing house. But it was in the kitchen garden where he made a startling discovery. Lying on the surface in the newly turned soil he found sherd after sherd of Anglo Saxon pottery. Luckily, he knew who to call. So, could this be the site of the Anglo Saxon Burh from which Burford took its name and just how much of the medieval hospital still exists in the walls and the grounds of the Priory?

In August 1943 the Romanians, no doubt prompted by merciless Allied bombing, overthrew their leader Antonescu and changed sides. Thereafter, events moved swiftly, the Russians soon captured the vital Pleosti oilfields, a huge loss to the German war effort, and within days the Soviets had taken Bucharest itself. A nervous Bulgaria sued for peace with the Allies, but the Russians pushed on into Sofia. Despite the German delaying tactics, Hungary fell next, although there were reinforcements from Axis troops stationed in Greece and Yugoslavia. In Yugoslavia itself the Germans held on grimly to Belgrade until October. The bloody fighting over, the Balkans were carved up and left to Soviet control in the immediate post war era, and the area remains a volatile political and ethnic mix to this very day.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.4.</episode-num></programme>

Theyve been invited to Norman Cross in rural Cambridgeshire to unearth the remains of the worlds first prisoner of war camp: a huge complex built by the British in 1797 to incarcerate 7000 Napoleonic soldiers and sailors. The camps design was groundbreaking, a far cry from the disease-ridden prison hulks previously used, but as the dig progresses, the team uncover a story worthy of a movie. It was a camp blighted by death, brutality and thousands of prisoners on the make. The archaeologists uncover rare examples of crafts that made some of the French inmates very rich men and evidence of gambling that left others penniless and naked. But in among the boys own stories, the diggers have a grimmer and more important task: to find the last resting place of almost 2000 prisoners who died of disease at Norman Cross. Mysteriously the location of their graves has been lost and with few historical documents the team must rely on their archaeological skills to find the cemetery. What they discover takes them all by surprise.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">16.9.</episode-num></programme>

In August 1943 the Romanians, no doubt prompted by merciless Allied bombing, overthrew their leader Antonescu and changed sides. Thereafter, events moved swiftly, the Russians soon captured the vital Pleosti oilfields, a huge loss to the German war effort, and within days the Soviets had taken Bucharest itself. A nervous Bulgaria sued for peace with the Allies, but the Russians pushed on into Sofia. Despite the German delaying tactics, Hungary fell next, although there were reinforcements from Axis troops stationed in Greece and Yugoslavia. In Yugoslavia itself the Germans held on grimly to Belgrade until October. The bloody fighting over, the Balkans were carved up and left to Soviet control in the immediate post war era, and the area remains a volatile political and ethnic mix to this very day.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">5.4.</episode-num></programme>

Theyve been invited to Norman Cross in rural Cambridgeshire to unearth the remains of the worlds first prisoner of war camp: a huge complex built by the British in 1797 to incarcerate 7000 Napoleonic soldiers and sailors. The camps design was groundbreaking, a far cry from the disease-ridden prison hulks previously used, but as the dig progresses, the team uncover a story worthy of a movie. It was a camp blighted by death, brutality and thousands of prisoners on the make. The archaeologists uncover rare examples of crafts that made some of the French inmates very rich men and evidence of gambling that left others penniless and naked. But in among the boys own stories, the diggers have a grimmer and more important task: to find the last resting place of almost 2000 prisoners who died of disease at Norman Cross. Mysteriously the location of their graves has been lost and with few historical documents the team must rely on their archaeological skills to find the cemetery. What they discover takes them all by surprise.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">16.9.</episode-num></programme>
