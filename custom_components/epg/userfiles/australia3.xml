Where can you find 1920s tires? A storyteller who works with tools instead of a pen, Rick shares when and why objects were invented, who used them and how fixing or transforming them changes their value.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.15.</episode-num></programme>

The encounter sets into action a startling chain of dramatic events. Trying desperately to understand what he has seen, Neary is increasingly driven to the emotional edge by the governmental cover up thats blocking him. With his wife struggling in vain to understand what is happening as their relationship disintegrates, Neary finds an ally in Jillian Guiler, a woman who has also witnessed nocturnal encounters and whose young son has been abducted by the alien visitors. As Roy and Jillian look for an answer to the extraordinary mystery that has engulfed them, an international team of scientists led by Claude Lacombe, a dedicated French expert on extraordinary phenomena, also pursues the truth. As Lacombe and company seek to understand the phenomenon of the skies and look for a communications break-through, their cosmic detective work reaches from the Indiana plains across the world to a remote hillside in India and then to the one place that holds the answer in an ultimate close encounter.</desc></programme>

Shed been stabbed to death in a frenzied attack that had left more than 60 wounds from her head to her feet. She had multiple bruises and broken bones and it was clear she had bravely fought back against a sustained attack. Glass fragments in her hair indicated she had been bashed around the head with a wine bottle. Although her clothes had been neatly cut away from her body, there was no evidence that she had been raped. The killing made news around the world. It was the first murder in more than a hundred years on an island famous for its history as a brutal penal colony and as home to the descendants of the notorious Bounty mutineers. With just 2771 residents and visitors on the island at the time, it was widely expected that the killer would be quickly identified and brought to justice.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">2.2.</episode-num></programme>

When new Indigenous inmate Tasha is put under Doreens care, Ferguson sees an opportunity to force Kaz into action against Bea. With Maxine as acting top dog, Ferguson places Tasha in Lucys orbit and when Tasha breaks the rules by protecting herself from Lucys molestation, Maxine appears to have no choice but to punish Tasha. Ferguson urges Kaz to stand up to Maxine and save the innocent girl from abuse at the hands of a man, thereby tapping into Kazs past trauma.

Seizing on the recent death of her father that sends Kaz into an inexplicable spiral, Ferguson realises that Kaz was a victim of abuse at his hands. Ferguson uses her own troubled relationship with her father as a means of forming a closer bond with Kaz. When new Indigenous inmate Tasha is put under Doreens care, Ferguson sees an opportunity to force Kaz into action against Bea. With Maxine as acting top dog, Ferguson places Tasha in Lucys orbit and when Tasha breaks the rules by protecting herself from Lucys molestation, Maxine appears to have no choice but to punish Tasha. Ferguson urges Kaz to stand up to Maxine and save the innocent girl from abuse at the hands of a man, thereby tapping into Kazs past trauma. Bea and Allys bond is cemented when they are slotted in adjoining cells and spend hours talking.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">3.4.</episode-num></programme>

Seizing on the recent death of her father that sends Kaz into an inexplicable spiral, Ferguson realises that Kaz was a victim of abuse at his hands. Ferguson uses her own troubled relationship with her father as a means of forming a closer bond with Kaz. When new Indigenous inmate Tasha is put under Doreens care, Ferguson sees an opportunity to force Kaz into action against Bea. With Maxine as acting top dog, Ferguson places Tasha in Lucys orbit and when Tasha breaks the rules by protecting herself from Lucys molestation, Maxine appears to have no choice but to punish Tasha. Ferguson urges Kaz to stand up to Maxine and save the innocent girl from abuse at the hands of a man, thereby tapping into Kazs past trauma.
